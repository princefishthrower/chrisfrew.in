If you've been wondering about how the internals of my blog are built and developed, you can now learn it from me, step by step, from [my very first course on Skillshare](https://skl.sh/2qGtFlG), titled "Build Your Personal Blog Website with GatsbyJS"! (Not to mention the source code of this site itself is all public [here on GitHub](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in)). 

Full disclosure, this blog _is_ a GatsbyJS site, which has been displayed in the footer since the blog first started.

At the end of October, I was invited to Skillshare to teach a course in web development. Over the past few years I've been taking out large amounts of free time to work towards being the best professional full stack developer that I can be. Today, this new stage of that goal has come to fruition. In the past three weeks, being new to video recording and editing, I built my course. Just yesterday, I finally published it. It was a great experience for me and I hope you give it a try if you are interested!

I decided to make my first course on Skillshare about building a blog site because through this blog, I've already networked with a variety of very cool people, and it's been extremely rewarding and motivating to me that there are people who can benefit from what I share! 

One kind soul has already donated to my blog for one of those detailed SAP ABAP posts. 🙏🙏🙏 I'm looking forward to make many more courses over the coming months (and years?!?) to give back to a community that has already given me so much! I'll be happy to post updates as this part of my career develops.

If you're interested, you can [use my promo link](https://skl.sh/2qGtFlG) to get 2 months of Skillshare for **FREE**, plus I'll get $10 for the referral! I'm pretty sure that is a win for you, me, and Skillshare!

If you decide to take the course, thank you! Be sure to tell me how I can improve, and what you don't like! Teaching software skills has been on my mind for a long time now, and Skillshare seemingly dropped out of the sky as a perfect platform to be able to do that.

Enjoy! :beer:
