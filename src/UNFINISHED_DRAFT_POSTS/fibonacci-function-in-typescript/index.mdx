## Recursive Fibonacci Calculation in TypeScript

In this quick tutorial, we'll walk through the creation of a Fibonacci calculation function in TypeScript. We'll be using a recursive approach with memoization to optimize the performance of our function.

## File Setup

Let's create a file named `fibonacci.ts`:

```typescript
// fibonacci.ts
```

This comment signifies that this file is called fibonacci.ts.

### Function Signature

Now, let's define the function signature. Our function will calculate the nth Fibonacci number, taking a single parameter 'n' of type 'number' and returning a number:

```typescript
const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {

};
```

## Add JS Doc Comment
For better documentation, let's add a brief JSDoc comment explaining the purpose of the function and the meaning of the 'n' parameter:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
 * @param n The position in the Fibonacci sequence.
 */
const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {

};
```

## Implement Fibonacci Logic
Now, let's implement the Fibonacci logic inside our function. We'll use a recursive approach:

```typescript
const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};
```

This recursive implementation checks if 'n' is '0' or '1'; if true, it returns 'n'. Otherwise, it recursively calls the Fibonacci function for n minus 1 and n minus 2, then adds them together.

## Optimize with Memoization
To improve performance, let's introduce memoization to our function:

```typescript
const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {
  const memo: Record<number, number> = {};
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  if (memo[n]) return memo[n];
  return memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};
```

Here, the 'memo' object stores previously calculated Fibonacci values, reducing redundant calculations and improving efficiency.

## Conclusion
Great! You've successfully created a Fibonacci calculation function in TypeScript using a recursive approach with memoization. This optimization enhances the performance of the function. Feel free to explore and experiment with different approaches. Until next time - cheers!
