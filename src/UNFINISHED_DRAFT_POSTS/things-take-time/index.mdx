As I currently write this, my artwork is hanging in the Zürich main station, viewed by thousands daily, I'm sitting on over $750 in futures trading profits from trading just 5 days this month, and [The Wheel Screener](https://wheelscreener.com) is completing it's second month on AppSumo, where I've gained nearly 100 new lifetime customers since July.

In otherwords, things are going very, very well, but I can't help but feel like after this enormous effort, I'm just a jack of all trades, master of none. In another sense, however, I'm glad I finally broke out of my shell. Even if all of these things amount to nothing, I'm glad I've done them, if nothing more than the sheer experience of it all is the result.

I begin to recognize that things in life come in ebs and flows. There are years that pass where nothing seems to happen, and then months that pass where nearly every aspect of my life seems to be excelling. Would I have been more successful if I had focused only on one of these areas with laser focus? Probably. But I think in this case I would have gotten bored with each of these things. I think one needs the contrast of various endeveours to bring them all together, if that makes any sense at all.
