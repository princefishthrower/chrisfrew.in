In a recent hacker news post, a village in ithaca new york was posted

I began daydreaming of something i've been thinking about 

I'm also hoping to finally answer for myself the age old "over population" rouse (which I think has been generally accepted to be debunked nowadays). My vision is calculating all the resources a single human uses in a year - and if that exceeds what can be replenished in a year (by perhaps the work and efforts of that same human), then we indeed have a big big problem on our hands.

We're going to take a time travel trip back to the 5th grade, and go through sections of what all life needs to survive: _food, water, shelter, and space._ Let's get started.

## Food

_Coffee_

For software engineers like me, this one is a reality wake up call. I've ran the numbers on this once before when I though of starting a sort of mountain coffee farm here in Austria. It is tough pill to swallow: without going to deep into the coffee growing weeds, for an adult to support their (albeit western) coffee drinking habits, most estimates are around the 25-30 plants range. That's quite a lot!

_Beer_

(not sure if that's the software engineer part or not)

_What about chocolate? Sweets in General?_

Oh boy. Another depressing step.

_Meat_

[According to 2012 numbers](https://www.quora.com/How-many-chickens-cows-pigs-and-fish-does-an-average-human-consume-in-a-year), that is:

27.43 chickens (including 26 chickens for meat and 1.43 chicken for eggs)
0.91 turkeys
0.40 pigs
0.14 cows
22 fish
218 shellfish

(As an aside, other authors like William MacAskill in [Doing Good Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better) also reflect these numbers in the notion that if you don't want to necessarily stop eating meat, but want to reduce overall animal suffering - then chicken is best to be cut out of your diet. Indeed, with careful planning and sharing in such an imagined self sustaining world

## Water

This one may be a small sigh of relief. An adult male is recommended to drink at least 1350 liters, or 357 gallons of water per year, while adult females at least 985 liters, or 260

- Collectors: One inch of rainfall equals 4.7 gallons of water per square yard. The average rainfall in the US is about 38 inches (I realize this varies durastically based on where, but we've got to take some assumptions or we'll never get to the end of this post.) So, on average in the U.S. you could get up to 178 gallons just from rain water collection alone. Most places however it would be as it has been done in the olden days: with a well.

## Shelter

Of this I had some ideas too. Could we rethink apartments and living even beyond the latest mini house and bus/van living we've seen? 

My imagination is this: 

1. put all devices together on a sort of 'device' wall: stove, oven, washing machine, dish washer, microwave. I'm sure come smart people could think up creative space saving ways to organize all those devices.

2. The smaller the space you need to live in, the less power you need. Sounds a bit dystopia-ish but it's something we should 

## Power

This one is a bit of a doozy, since it pulls in essentially all previous sections - you've got to have some heat in that shelter, perhaps some sort of pump to pump that water

## Time

Now the time it takes to do all this. Could a single person even have time to do all this in a given year? We'll assume that their own self sustaining abilities literally _is_ their job, so they can give a good 8 hours plus a day to work towards it.

_Other Details_

Keep in mind you wouldn't even be able to grow some of these plants depending on where you may live currently. I'd argue most of the 'western' world is all but inhospitable to plants that give us our tasty coffee, sugar, and cocoa
