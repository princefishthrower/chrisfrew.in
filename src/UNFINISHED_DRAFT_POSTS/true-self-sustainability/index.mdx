## What Would it Take to Be Complete Self Sustainable?

This is you.

All alone, you've got nothing you need to survive yet.

## Food.

Let's start with food. (Since I'm from the United States, I'm going to go with their statistics on what an average U.S. citizen consumes per year. Of course this varies _heavily_ based on what country the person is from.)

The average american drinks about 44 ounces of water per day, so for the year, you'll need 16,060 ounces, or 125 gallons, or 4 barrels of water for the year:

Dairy makes up the largest portion of our diets, at 630 pounds of milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream per year. 31 of that is just cheese! Only (and I say only very lightly) one cow is needed to sustain this, as a healthy cow can produce more than 1 gallon of milk per day. (That equates to just under a gallon of milk, or 1 pound of hard cheese if you want hard cheese, or two pounds of soft cheese if you want soft cheese.) A cow will also yield over 400 hamburgers for a year, but we'll get to that later... ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜¢. Anyway, here's our cow with us:

But we're still not done. A cow needs grazing land, 1.8 acres on average per year:

...aaand the problem goes deeper. The cow needs some water as well, and about . Let's add those barrels to your homestead. Even after all using up all this space and resources, a typical dairy cow is usually culled (i.e. selected for slaughter) after only 6 years.

Note that if you want to be a high roller and want arrangement of your dairy, you could add in a goat and a sheep:

But wait! Like the cow, these animals don't come for free. A goat requires approximately 1/4 acre of grazing land, and a sheep 1/3. Together they'll also need about of water per year.

Finally if your choosing to go self-sustainable in a climate with winters, you're gonna need a barn for the cold 2-5 months of the year. Let's add that to the plot of your rapidly growing homestead:

_and_ you'll need the extra land to grow grass to feed all your animals for the winter:

Damn... with only the dairy products accounted for, no matter if you go cow only or high roller route, our planetary impact as a single individual is already starting to look huge, and our place crowded. (and we haven't even built our _shelter_ yet!)

Next up in food is our veggies: 415 pounds of vegetables per year. Following the United States diet, the leaders are corn and potatoes, at

Next is fruit: we eat 273 pounds of fruit per year. If you are not picky, a single adult apple tree would suffice, which yields 500 lbs of fruit per year:

However, if you _are_ picky, you could choose a variety of common treed fruits that grow decently in a variety of climates: apples, pears, plums, oranges, peaches, and cherries. You could also go with one tree of each, but be warned that not all of these grow very well when on their own

Then, the fake stuff: 141 pounds of sweeteners. 42 pounds of corn syrup. This is an _extremlely_ tough one, and shows how much like kings even the poorest United States citzens are living (sorry I'm not sorry for evoking rage from that sentance; its true.). If you wanted to produce 141 pounds of sweeteners per year, you'd need to cultivate nearly _one ton_ of sugar cane per year, which would be approximately

Finally, the last thing we need is our meat. We need to feed our cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs. We need to feed our chickens, and we need to feed our rabbits.

And finally 85 pounds of fats not included in the other foods, i.e. oils.

_Coffee_

For software engineers like me, this one is a reality wake up call. I've ran the numbers on this once before when I though of starting a sort of mountain coffee farm here in Austria. It is tough pill to swallow: without going to deep into the coffee growing weeds, for an adult to support their (albeit western) coffee drinking habits, most estimates are around the 25-30 plants range. That's quite a lot!

_Beer_

(not sure if that's the software engineer part or not)

_What about chocolate? Sweets in General?_

Oh boy. Another depressing step.

_Meat_

[According to 2012 numbers](https://www.quora.com/How-many-chickens-cows-pigs-and-fish-does-an-average-human-consume-in-a-year), that is:

27.43 chickens (including 26 chickens for meat and 1.43 chicken for eggs)
0.91 turkeys
0.40 pigs
0.14 cows
22 fish
218 shellfish

(As an aside, other authors like William MacAskill in [Doing Good Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better) also reflect these numbers in the notion that if you don't want to necessarily stop eating meat, but want to reduce overall animal suffering - then chicken is best to be cut out of your diet. Indeed, with careful planning and sharing in such an imagined self sustaining world

## Water

-   Collectors: One inch of rainfall equals 4.7 gallons of water per square yard. The average rainfall in the US is about 38 inches (I realize this varies durastically based on where, but we've got to take some assumptions or we'll never get to the end of this post.) So, on average in the U.S. you could get up to 178 gallons just from rain water collection alone. Most places however it would be as it has been done in the olden days: with a well.

## Shelter

Of this I had some ideas too. Could we rethink apartments and living even beyond the latest mini house and bus/van living we've seen?

My imagination is this:

1. put all devices together on a sort of 'device' wall: stove, oven, washing machine, dish washer, microwave. I'm sure come smart people could think up creative space saving ways to organize all those devices.

2. The smaller the space you need to live in, the less power you need. Sounds a bit dystopia-ish but it's something we should

## Power

This one is a bit of a doozy, since it pulls in essentially all previous sections - you've got to have some heat in that shelter, perhaps some sort of pump to pump that water

## Waste

Everyone's got to do it right? We generate up to 200 gallons of urine and 90 gallons of feces per year, which reduces only by about 40% by bacteria that eat it. So we'll need a place to put all that:

Oh yeah - and you'll need more water for a proper septic system too: **a whole 50 - 70 gallons more**.

## Time

Great. We've got all our crap now to live like a rich United States citizen. Now the time it takes to do all this. Could a single person even have time to do all this in a given year? We'll assume that their own self sustaining abilities literally _is_ their job, so they can give a good 8 hours plus a day to work towards it. Here's just a short list of just the key things you'll need to keep up:

-   Milk your cow (and goat and sheep if you so choose)
-   Grow and cultivate your grains and veggies

_Other Details_

Keep in mind you wouldn't even be able to grow some of these plants depending on where you may live currently. I'd argue most of the 'western' world is all but inhospitable to plants that give us our tasty coffee, sugar, and cocoa
