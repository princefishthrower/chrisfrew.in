# Efficient JSON Deserialization in .NET: A Modern Approach

In .NET applications, dealing with HTTP responses often involves deserializing JSON data into objects. Traditionally, this process involved reading the entire response content as a string and then deserializing it. However, this approach can be inefficient, especially for large responses, as it requires allocating memory for the entire string.

In this blog post, we'll explore a more efficient way to deserialize JSON directly from an HTTP response content in .NET, avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.

## The Old Way

Previously, we would commonly use `ReadAsStringAsync()` to read the response content as a string and then deserialized it using libraries like Newtonsoft.Json. In many backend methods of my SaaS product, [The Wheel Screener](https://wheelscreener.com), I was using this method:

```csharp
var apiResponse = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    // We need our custom decimal converter to handle those pesky "NaN" strings
    var settings = new JsonSerializerSettings
    {
        NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
        MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Ignore,
        Formatting = Formatting.None,
        DateFormatHandling = DateFormatHandling.IsoDateFormat,
        Converters = new List<JsonConverter> { new DecimalConverter() }
    };
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<OptionChainResponseModel>(apiResponse, settings);
}
```

In this code snippet, `ReadAsStringAsync()` is used to read the entire response content as a string, which can be memory-intensive, especially for large responses (and trust me when I say an option chain is a LARGE response!). Then, `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject()` from Newtonsoft.Json is used to deserialize the JSON string into the desired object type.

## The Modern Approach

With the advancements in .NET, particularly in ASP.NET Core, there's a more efficient and convenient way to deserialize JSON directly from an HTTP response content. You can use the `HttpContentExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync<T>` method, which handles the deserialization process internally, without the need to read the entire content as a string manually.

Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Json;

// Assuming 'response' is your HttpResponseMessage
var result = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<OptionChainResponseModel>();
```

This method directly deserializes the JSON content of the HTTP response into the specified type, without the need for intermediate steps such as reading the content as a string manually.

## But those Newtonsoft.Json settings?

Let's go through one by one and tackle each of the custom settings I had in the old code.

### NullValueHandling

In the new method, `null` values are ignored by default, which is the same as `NullValueHandling.Ignore` in Newtonsoft.Json. So we're good here.

### MissingMemberHandling

In the new method, missing members are ignored by default, which is the same as `MissingMemberHandling.Ignore` in Newtonsoft.Json. So, once again, we're good here.

### Formatting

In the new method, the default formatting is `None`, which is the same as `Formatting.None` in Newtonsoft.Json. So, we're good here.

### DateFormatHandling

In the new method, the default date format handling is automatically according to ISO standards. All set.

### Converters

Converters are ever so slightly different. I need one because the default value for some of the decimal values in various option metrics are "NaN". These need to be converted to `null` in my application. Here's what my old Newtonsoft.Json converter looked like:

```csharp
public class DecimalConverter : JsonConverter
{

    public override bool CanConvert(Type objectType)
    {
        return (objectType == typeof(decimal) || objectType == typeof(decimal?));
    }

    public override object ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, object existingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        try
        {
            JToken token = JToken.Load(reader);
            if (token.Type == JTokenType.Float || token.Type == JTokenType.Integer)
            {
                return token.ToObject<decimal>();
            }
            if (token.Type == JTokenType.String)
            {
                if (token.ToString() == "NaN")
                {
                    return null;
                }
                // customize this to suit your needs
                return Decimal.Parse(token.ToString());
            }
            if (token.Type == JTokenType.Null && objectType == typeof(decimal?))
            {
                return null;
            }
            
        } catch
        {
            return null;
        }
        return null;
    }

    public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, object value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

}
```

In the new method, you can use the `JsonConverter` attribute to specify a custom converter for a specific property. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// TODO: Add a custom converter for the decimal properties
```

## Conclusion

In summary, when deserializing JSON responses in .NET applications, it's essential to consider memory efficiency, especially for handling large responses. By adopting modern approaches like `HttpContentExtensions.GetFromJsonAsync<T>` or directly deserializing from a stream with `System.Text.Json`, you can improve the performance and memory usage of your application.

Upgrade your codebase to leverage these modern techniques and enjoy more efficient JSON deserialization in your .NET projects.
