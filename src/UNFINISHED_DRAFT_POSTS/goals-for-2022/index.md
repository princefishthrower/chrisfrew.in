# Another Year Goes By...

Whew... this year has been _insane_. I quit my old freelancing job, launched my first profitable (!) SaaS product, interviewed with a handful of software companies, signed and worked for a month as an offical employee of one of those companies, and in the end, quit that job and started at a Swiss start up, where I'm happily employed now! All in one year.

I'm exhausted.

Just like every year, I set a set of goals or resolutions for the coming year, and also review and grade myself for the past year's goals. Here's that post for 2022.

# Goals for 2021, Reviewed


- Close on a house! (Scary :scream:)

‚ùå Not quite yet... though we are going to look while we're in the United States 

- Publish five SkillShare courses by April 11th, 2021, and tie it with socials, YouTube, and digital art (more below)

‚ùå Only managed to publish 3 - these courses take longer than I think they will each time, however, considering all the other platforms that recruited me, where my courses are available, _and_ the two courses i have in the works coming out early next year, we could probably put a ‚úÖ here technically, or at least I'd like to think so

- Video games and drinking only allowed on Fridays (exceptions: parties, holidays)

‚ùå Fail here, though I have drank a lot less overall this year, especially for the first four months of the year where I 

- Start daily meditation

‚úÖ I'm going to put this . For all of January and February

- Start intermittent fasting

‚úÖ Definitely was doing this for quite a while. On Mondays and Tuesdays I was 

- Find a publisher and publish my book

‚ùå Things just take so much time.

- Start a second book
- Do some insane super hikes
- More camping
- Run a marathon

While my review looks bad in this format (quite a lot of ‚ùå's), I think I should highlight a lot of huge wins, as 2021 was the first year in which I:

- Created (and continue to develop and maintain) my first profitable SaaS product, [The Wheel Screener](https://wheelscreener.com)!
- Earned over $2000 in course royalties across all various platforms I sell my courses on
- Gained over 100 followers on [Full Stack Craft's YouTube channel]()
- Was hired to a senior full stack software engineering position (twice!), while at the same time denying two other promising offers
- Gained equity in InClub (my current full time employment) - crossing our fingers as we grow and look for more investors - but the work alone is exciting and varied enough to keep me very motivated
- Was featured in my first dev podcast, [React Round Up](https://reactroundup.com/modernizing-your-react-apps-with-typescript-ft-chris-frewin-rru-163) (for me, the real sign that I "made it" üòÇ)

# Goals for 2022

Okay, with that little ego boost for myself, here's what I've got for goals for 2022:

- Say no more
- Write a cool backend in Go
- In addition to the two "secret" courses I'm currently working on, publish one course

### Saying No More

I'm finally getting to that point in my career (or that point in my age üòÇ) where I just don't have time to handle all the offers that come at me. I need to 

### Write a Cool Backend in Go

As I've been working through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year [in Go](), I've also been studying it on the side as a possible next gen API for my work at [InClub](). Overall, I'm impressed with the speed of Go, but more importantly, the philosophy and mindset behind the language: no pretty or extra bells and whistles, composition and business functionality should drive your code, and . It's a clean, lightweight tool that is easily portable and extremely powerful as a backend language. Whether it turns out to be for InClub, or for a side SaaS project of mine, I'm eager to build something using Go in 2022.

# Thanks!

Well, that's it. Looking forward to 2022 and getting my act together as an adult.

Cheers üç∫
