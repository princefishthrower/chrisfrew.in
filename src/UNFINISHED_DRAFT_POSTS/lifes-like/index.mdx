A lot of you will immediately find this cheesy and stop reading approximately 3 sentances in. But this is a deep post

To start, let me know if this story sounds familiar (if it is you'll probably be one of those to stick around):

In college, you were maybe a bit to a lot more motivated than your fellow students. You were different than those who "had it easy in highschool" and then struggled in freshman physics and calculus classes; in fact, you were the opposite; finding your stride freshman year and finding that classes and exams just a bit easier than all your peers. It definitely didn't come for free and without hard work, but nonetheless, you excelled. Already by sophomore year, you were taking graduate level classes and doing research with professors. You were the one who was going to change the world. You remember telling this to your close friends, who also were doing amazing things with their research and getting scholarships left and right, specifically: "we are going to weave the fabric of this world". You remember the day you got accepted to grad school - ivy league, of course. You were so excited. You were going to get a PhD, be the leading edge of your field. You were going to be a researcher. You were going to change the world. You remember even fellow classmates saying "you're going to do something big with your life", and "you have that spark that not many people have."

...And what could I do but acknowledge all that as fact?

...I founded a company while still in my undergrad.

...I coded the energy distribution of electrons around a hydrogen atom in MATLAB.

...I completed 3 different research projects and traveled to 2 different countries while studying.

...I was the only one it my class to graduate with a dual degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering.

...In my masters, I was the first to publish and the only one to get through in 1 year.

...I've run a marathon.

...I've started an LLC with multiple successful SaaS products and courses.

...I've made over $1000 trading futures - multiple times.

And yet, it's all not enough. It's not enough. If you don't advertise your skills, if you don't market, you could have the unifying field theory printed on multiple online blogs, and no one would give a shit. It's just the way things work now.

Fast-forward: 

Wake up, in the dark.
Commute 45 minutes to work.
Work for 8-9 hours.
Commute 45 minutes back home.
Hit the gym for an hour.

In short, you've fallen into the fast swath of the population that is the 9-5, a token of history with no remarkable feats. You're not a researcher, you're not a professor, you're not a CEO. You're just a guy. You're just a guy who works a 9-5. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games and watches Netflix. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games and watches Netflix and sleeps. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games and watches Netflix and sleeps and eats. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games and watches Netflix and sleeps and eats and shits. You're just a guy who works a 9-5 and goes to the gym and plays video games and watches Netflix and sleeps and eats and shits and dies.

Okay, that paragraph is a bit eerie - copilot hallucinated everything after the "You're just a guy" sentence.

And yet (and I feel exhausted just saying this)... I'm not going to give up.
