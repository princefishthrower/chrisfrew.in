Originally published here, also [_published on Medium._](https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/run-an-existing-magento-2-app-for-development-with-homebrew-apache-on-macos-in-2018-2019-9d40bc1e823a)

So, I started working on a new Magento project with my boss this past weekend, and sitting together at a café, it took us about 5 hours to get the site fully working for development. 😂 😂 😂 While Magento provides a lot of powerful tools for building e-commerce sites, it's a beast to get started up, especially if one of you has only done it on Windows, and one of you has a Mac. 😉 I documented everything we sludged through in those 5 hours, and this post was born!

This is a tutorial that boils down the steps that worked for us (trust me when I say there were many steps we took that _didn't_ work), so hopefully it can take _you_ only 30 minutes to an hour 😊

## mcrypt and intl PHP Extensions

If you follow some standard Apache PHP 7.1 on-boarding or getting started guide, you will see that everything goes smoothly, _until_ you try to install Magento dependecies with `composer update`, and find that Magento needs the `mcrypt` and `intl` PHP extensions:

```
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
  Problem 1
    - magento/product-community-edition 2.2.5 requires ext-mcrypt * -> the requested PHP extension mcrypt is missing from your system.
    - magento/product-community-edition 2.2.5 requires ext-intl * -> the requested PHP extension intl is missing from your system.
    - Installation request for magento/product-community-edition 2.2.5 -> satisfiable by magento/product-community-edition[2.2.5].
```

The MacOS system version of PHP doesn't ship with these! :scream: :scream: :scream:

Luckily, the Homebrew version does!

## Homebrew to the Rescue

I'm going to show you how to get up and running developing your Magento app using Homebrew packages. Note that the config files and start commands for Apache, as well as the path to the desired PHP location, are different than the standard system apache commands!

So, before we do anything with brew, we need to shut down the system instance of Apache (mac normally ships with Apache, so let's do this now):

```
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist
```

Now we will install the the Homebrew versions of Apache and PHP. And while we're at it, if you don't have it installed already, we will also need `composer`, the package manager for Magento, so let's just tack that on the end as well:

```
brew install php71 httpd composer
```

## Edits to Homebrew's Apache httpd.conf

Edit the Homebrew Apache .conf file with:

```
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
```

Now we need to make some changes to `httpd.conf`.

Ensure that the PHP module points to the Homebrew version of PHP (not the system version, which doesn't have `mcrypt` and `intl`)! and not commented out:

```
LoadModule php7_module /usr/local/opt/php@7.1/lib/httpd/modules/libphp7.so
```

and also add:

```
<FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

And then, on the second DocumentRoot / Directory block (don't mess with the first one!), change the path and point it to your root of your Magento project:

```
DocumentRoot "/Your/Awesome/Magento/Project"
<Directory "/Your/Awesome/Magento/Project">
...
```

A Magento app may also need AllowOverride rule set to All inside that `<Directory>` block:

```
AllowOverride All
```

And also, for development, the `rewrite_module` may also need to be activated (if you see you are getting a lot of 404 not found errors on `localhost:8080`)

```
LoadModule rewrite_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_rewrite.so
```

Great. That should be all thats needed for apache to run a Magento app. Now we need to install Magento dependencies using composer, which we installed in the very first step of this tutorial. Navigate to your Magento project root and issue:

```
composer update
```

Then it may say that you need to login. If you don't have a Magento account yet, head to their website and sign up. Go right ahead and create a new public / private key pair for a project (at [https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/)) - Make sure it is for the correct version of Magento. 

![Magento Account Keys](magento-account-keys.png)

We are going to use these keys right away, because, when the terminal prompts you for first your 'username', this is actually your public key from your Magento account, NOT your Magento email or username. Your 'password' prompt in the terminal is likewise your private key, NOT your Magento login password. 

You'll know you've messed up the login to composer if you are getting a big error that looks like this:

```
 [Composer\Downloader\TransportException]                                     
  Invalid credentials for 'https://repo.magento.com/packages.json', aborting.
```

In my opinion this is pretty misleading and should really be changed by the Magento Team.

In the least, Magento will prompt in the terminal if you would like to save those credentials, so you only have to do it once:

```
Do you want to store credentials for repo.magento.com in /Users/chris/.composer/auth.json ? [Yn]
```

(I said `Y` 😊)

Check that everything from composer update looks okay. Everything should be successful, at the worst some warnings at the end.

## Checking the Site and Additional Magento Commands

So again, if you haven’t already, start with:

```
composer update
```

then enable all the modules:

```
bin/magento module:enable --all
```

Then compile the modules:

```
bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

If you get a complaint about memory, run `bin/magento` with the PHP memory option:

```
php -d memory_limit=512M bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

To allot 512 Mb to the process (you may find you need more)

Finally, we can navigate to the site. As we left the Homebrew defaults in our apache config, your site should be at localhost:8080. (System Apache is at port 80, but we deactivated it anyway). Magento may then complain that you need to upgrade your modules, something like this:

```
1 exception(s):
Exception #0 (Magento\Framework\Exception\LocalizedException): Please upgrade your database: Run "bin/magento setup:upgrade" from the Magento root directory.
The following modules are outdated:
[redacted] schema: current version - 1.0.7, required version - 1.0.8
[redacted] data: current version - 1.0.7, required version - 1.0.8
```

Just do what it says with:

```
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

In your root directory. That’s it! You should be all set to get developing with your Magento site on localhost:8080!

## Additional Troubleshooting and  Useful Info

If, after all this config, you are getting something similar to this error on `localhost:8080`:

```
Authentication plugin 'caching_sha2_password' cannot be loaded: dlopen(/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so, 2): image not found
```

The SQL user with which Magento interacts with its databases needs to use the legacy version of logging in. If you've created your user with MySQL workbench for example, the default login setting may instead be with a cached sha2 password. We can change this for our SQL user with (within a SQL terminal):

```
ALTER USER 'putYourMagentoSQLUsernameHereIncludingQuotes'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'putYourMagentoSQLUserPasswordHereIncludingQuotes';
```

If you are getting some weird errors about the generated content, you may need to clean the cache, delete `generated/` and `var/` folders, and change permissions on them (this would be in the root of your Magento project):

```
bin/magento cache:clean && rm -r ./generated/ && mkdir ./generated && chmod -R 777 ./generated && rm -r ./var/ && mkdir ./var && chmod -R 777 ./var
```

## Httpd.conf for Reference

For reference, here is the entirety of my `httpd.conf` file that is currently working (I have changed only the folder name to respect the name of the project client):

```
#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/access_log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr/local/apache2" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log", whereas "/logs/access_log" 
# will be interpreted as '/logs/access_log'.

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
# least PidFile.
#
ServerRoot "/usr/local/opt/httpd"

#
# Mutex: Allows you to set the mutex mechanism and mutex file directory
# for individual mutexes, or change the global defaults
#
# Uncomment and change the directory if mutexes are file-based and the default
# mutex file directory is not on a local disk or is not appropriate for some
# other reason.
#
# Mutex default:/usr/local/var/run/httpd

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 8080

#
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.

    # If the AddEncoding directives above are commented-out, then you
    # probably should define those extensions to indicate media types:
    #
    AddType application/x-compress .Z
    AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz

    #
    # AddHandler allows you to map certain file extensions to "handlers":
    # actions unrelated to filetype. These can be either built into the server
    # or added with the Action directive (see below)
    #
    # To use CGI scripts outside of ScriptAliased directories:
    # (You will also need to add "ExecCGI" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

    # For type maps (negotiated resources):
    #AddHandler type-map var

    #
    # Filters allow you to process content before it is sent to the client.
    #
    # To parse .shtml files for server-side includes (SSI):
    # (You will also need to add "Includes" to the "Options" directive.)
    #
    #AddType text/html .shtml
    #AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
</IfModule>

#
# The mod_mime_magic module allows the server to use various hints from the
# contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile
# directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.
#
#MIMEMagicFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/magic

#
# Customizable error responses come in three flavors:
# 1) plain text 2) local redirects 3) external redirects
#
# Some examples:
#ErrorDocument 500 "The server made a boo boo."
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
#ErrorDocument 402 http://www.example.com/subscription_info.html
#

#
# MaxRanges: Maximum number of Ranges in a request before
# returning the entire resource, or one of the special
# values 'default', 'none' or 'unlimited'.
# Default setting is to accept 200 Ranges.
#MaxRanges unlimited

#
# EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile: On systems that support it, 
# memory-mapping or the sendfile syscall may be used to deliver
# files.  This usually improves server performance, but must
# be turned off when serving from networked-mounted 
# filesystems or if support for these functions is otherwise
# broken on your system.
# Defaults: EnableMMAP On, EnableSendfile Off
#
#EnableMMAP off
#EnableSendfile on

# Supplemental configuration
#
# The configuration files in the /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/ directory can be 
# included to add extra features or to modify the default configuration of 
# the server, or you may simply copy their contents here and change as 
# necessary.

# Server-pool management (MPM specific)
#Include /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-mpm.conf

# Multi-language error messages

</IfModule>

# Secure (SSL/TLS) connections
#Include /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
#
# Note: The following must must be present to support
#       starting without SSL on platforms with no /dev/random equivalent
#       but a statically compiled-in mod_ssl.
#
<IfModule ssl_module>

I hope this was useful to those getting started with an existing Magento 2 project on macOS!
