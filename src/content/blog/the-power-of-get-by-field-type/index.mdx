Let's say we've got a function for which only comparison operators make sense. In this case, a function that compares a given property of two same-typed objects and tells you if the first is greater than the second:

```typescript
function greaterThan<T>(a: T, b: T, property: any): boolean {
    return a[property] > b[property];
}
```

Instead of that ugly looking (and incorrect) `any` type for `property`, we should instead allow only the types that make sense for the greater than (`>`) operator: `string`, `Date`, and `number`.

## Introducing `PropertiesOfType`

I introduce to you the type util, `PropertiesOfType`:

```typescript
type PropertiesOfType<Type, ValueTypes> = { [K in keyof Type]: Type[K] extends ValueTypes ? K : never }[keyof Type];
```

This type can select the keys of any type according to the value of `ValueTypes`. Because TypeScript is amazing, `Type` can be generic! So for our example, we could use:

```typescript
property: PropertiesOfType<T, string | Date | number>
```

Or incorporated into `greaterThan`:

```typescript
function greaterThan<T>(a: T, b: T, property: PropertiesOfType<T, >): boolean {
    return a[property] > b[property];
}
```

Many thanks to `carlvincentld` [on the TypeScript GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/24560) for clarifying how `Extract` works and providing me with this solution!

## Thanks!
