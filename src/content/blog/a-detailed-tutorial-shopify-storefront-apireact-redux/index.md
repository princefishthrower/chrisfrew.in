# A Detailed Tutorial: Shopify‚Äôs Storefront API + React + Redux

## E-commerce for all! (‚Ä¶websites, that is üòÑ)

*Written by *[Chris](https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher)* on Wednesday,
August 22nd, 2018*

#### Background and Motivation

So the motivation here was pretty simple. I wanted my users to be able to
browse, search, and select products directly on my custom domain without having
to go to Shopify.

The secondary motivation is that I‚Äôd much rather have my own codebase for a
website than use one of Shopify‚Äôs factory templates. No offence Shopify team!
The templates are modern and clean, but they are rather basic.

So this is the best of both worlds ‚Äî my custom React site (already built and
online üòÑ), with the added API and checkout process of Shopify!

By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll be able to add your Shopify products on
*any* page of your site. The only part of the shopping process that will occur
on Shopify is when the user clicks ‚ÄòCheckout‚Äô.

The motivation specifically for writing here on Medium was simply that I
couldn‚Äôt find a tutorial on this process myself‚Äî so I decided to make one
myself!

I‚Äôve been a professional developer for 4 years now, and programming for 7. I‚Äôve
worked in tech stacks from old-school Fortran and Perl to React, Javascript, and
Nodejs.

Siren Apparel is one of my side project / startup / maker company that I‚Äôve run
for 5 years now, and we‚Äôve donated to 5 different police and fire departments.

Let‚Äôs finally get started with this tutorial.

#### Shopify‚Äôs Storefront API

The wonderful folks at Shopify have put together the [Storefront
API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/custom-storefronts/storefront-api). With
the Storefront API, you can create React components to add product pictures,
product variations, product sizes, a cart, and ‚Äòadd to cart‚Äô and ‚Äòcheckout‚Äô
buttons into your own, non-Shopify site.

Note that this tutorial is NOT about [Shopify
Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris), which is used to create components
in React for Shopify store management itself.

#### Getting Started: `react-js-buy` Repository

Take a look at [this React example built by the Shopify
team](https://github.com/Shopify/storefront-api-examples/tree/master/react-js-buy).
Most of the code in this walkthrough tutorial comes from that repository.

‚Ä¶Did you take a look? Good!

Now we‚Äôre going to hop right into code! Head to your React site‚Äôs root folder
and install the `shopify-buy` module via the terminal:

```bash
cd my-awesome-react-node-project/
npm install --save shopify-buy
```

(or `yarn add shopify-buy` if you prefer `yarn`)

Then, in your frontend `index.js`, (note: NOT `App.js`!) you will need to import
`Client` from the JS Buy SDK:

```javascript
import Client from 'shopify-buy';
```

Then add the following configuration object above the `ReactDOM.render()`call:

```javascript
const client = Client.buildClient({
    storefrontAccessToken: 'your-access-token',
    domain: 'your-shopify-url.myshopify.com'
});
```

That‚Äôs it for `index.js` for now ‚Äî we‚Äôll come back to it soon.

Now we‚Äôre going to add in all the components needed for a smooth shopping and
checkout experience. Copy all the components from the `react-js-buy` repository:

`Cart.js`

`LineItem.js`

`Product.js`

`Products.js`

`VariantSelector.js`

We will paste these components into a`components/shopify/` folder in your `src/`
folder. You could put these component files anywhere else in the `src/` folder,
if you wished. The rest of the tutorial assumes you have put them in
`components/shopify/` .

#### Modifying App.js

`App.js` will need extensive changes. First, import that Cart component you just
copied into your own project:

```javascript
import Cart from './components/shopify/Cart';
```

If your `App.js` component was stateless, like mine, you should be safe copying
this entire `constructor()` function:

```javascript
constructor() {
    super();
    this.updateQuantityInCart = this.updateQuantityInCart.bind(this);
    this.removeLineItemInCart = this.removeLineItemInCart.bind(this);
    this.handleCartClose = this.handleCartClose.bind(this);
}
```

if you already have state, copy only those `bind` lines. They are event handler
functions that the Shopify cart needs to function properly.

‚ÄúBut what about state for the cart!?‚Äù

You may ask; or:

‚ÄúWhat about defining those four methods for the cart!?‚Äù

Indeed, that‚Äôs coming, but not yet! üòÑ

You can then append the `<Cart/>` component to the bottom of your render()
function, before the ending div. In my opinion, the cart should be accessible
anywhere in your app. I think it makes sense then to put the `<Cart/>` component
in the root component of your app:

```javascript
    return (
    <div>
    ...
    <Cart
        checkout={this.state.checkout}
        isCartOpen={this.state.isCartOpen}
        handleCartClose={this.handleCartClose}
        updateQuantityInCart={this.updateQuantityInCart}
        removeLineItemInCart={this.removeLineItemInCart}
     />
    </div>
    );
```

So, you may have noticed I didn‚Äôt include any code on the event handlers for the
cart yet. Additionally, I didn‚Äôt address the lack of state components for the
cart in App.js.

Well, about halfway through this project, I realized my products component was
not in my `App.js` file.

Instead, it was buried about three children components down.

So instead of passing products three levels down to children, and then function
handlers all the way back up‚Ä¶

I decided to use‚Ä¶

**üò± Redux!!! üò±**

Ugh! I know, I know, Redux, while not being very difficult, is a pain in the
%*$! to wire up initially with all the boilerplate required. But, if you are a
developer working on an E-commerce store or an E-commerce store owner, think of
it this way: Redux will enable you to access the state of the cart from any
component or page in our app.

This ability will be essential as Siren Apparel expands and we develop more
products. As we create more products, I‚Äôll make a seperate dedicated store page
with all products, while leaving just a handful of featured products on the
homepage.

The ability to access the cart is essential if a user shops around a bit, reads
some stories or info about Siren Apparel, and *then* decides to checkout. It
doesn‚Äôt matter how much they navigate around, nothing from their cart will be
lost!

So, in short, I decided it‚Äôs probably better to implement Redux now while the
codebase for [our site](https://sirenapparel.us/) isn‚Äôt too large.

#### Implementing Redux for Shopify Buy SDK With Bare Minimum Boilerplate

Install NPM packages `redux` and `react-redux`:

```bash
npm install --save redux react-redux
```

In `index.js` , import `Provider` from `react-redux`and your `store` from
`./store`:

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
```

Wrap the `<Provider>` component with the passed `store` around your`<App>`in
`index.js`to hook up your App to your Redux store:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
<Provider store={store}>
    <IntlProvider locale={locale} messages={flattenMessages(messages[locale.substring(0, 2)])}>
      <App locale={locale}/>
    </IntlProvider>
 </Provider>,
document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Note that I also have a `<IntlProvider>`, but that‚Äôs in [a different post about
how I applied internationalization and localization to dynamically render the
content on Siren Apparel‚Äôs
site.](https://medium.com/@sirenapparel/internationalization-and-localization-of-sirenapparel-eu-sirenapparel-us-and-sirenapparel-asia-ddee266066a2)
A different story for a different day.

Now of course we haven‚Äôt made a `./store.js` file yet. Create your store in
`store.js`in the `src/` root and put this in it:

```javascript
import {createStore} from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducers/cart'; 

export default createStore(reducer);
```

Create your reducers file in `src/reducers/cart.js`and paste this code:

```javascript
// initial state
const initState = {
  isCartOpen: false,
  checkout: { lineItems: [] },
  products: [],
  shop: {}
}

// actions
const CLIENT_CREATED = 'CLIENT_CREATED'
const PRODUCTS_FOUND = 'PRODUCTS_FOUND'
const CHECKOUT_FOUND = 'CHECKOUT_FOUND'
const SHOP_FOUND = 'SHOP_FOUND'
const ADD_VARIANT_TO_CART = 'ADD_VARIANT_TO_CART'
const UPDATE_QUANTITY_IN_CART = 'UPDATE_QUANTITY_IN_CART'
const REMOVE_LINE_ITEM_IN_CART = 'REMOVE_LINE_ITEM_IN_CART'
const OPEN_CART = 'OPEN_CART'
const CLOSE_CART = 'CLOSE_CART'

// reducers
export default (state = initState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case CLIENT_CREATED:
      return {...state, client: action.payload}
    case PRODUCTS_FOUND:
      return {...state, products: action.payload}
    case CHECKOUT_FOUND:
      return {...state, checkout: action.payload}
    case SHOP_FOUND:
      return {...state, shop: action.payload}
    case ADD_VARIANT_TO_CART:
      return {...state, isCartOpen: action.payload.isCartOpen, checkout: action.payload.checkout}
    case UPDATE_QUANTITY_IN_CART:
      return {...state, checkout: action.payload.checkout}
    case REMOVE_LINE_ITEM_IN_CART:
      return {...state, checkout: action.payload.checkout}
    case OPEN_CART:
      return {...state, isCartOpen: true}
    case CLOSE_CART:
      return {...state, isCartOpen: false}
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to just post this big reducer and not discuss what is
going on; we‚Äôll get to each event! Note a few things:

We take the initial state from what the state is written as in the Shopify
GitHub example and put it in our initState, namely the following four parts of
state:

```javascript
isCartOpen: false,
checkout: { lineItems: [] },
products: [],
shop: {}
```

However, in my implementation, I also create a `client` part of the state. I
call the `createClient()` function once and then immediately set it in the Redux
state in `index.js` . So let‚Äôs head into `index.js`:

#### Back to index.js

```javascript
const client = Client.buildClient({
  storefrontAccessToken: 'your-shopify-token',
  domain: 'your-shopify-url.myshopify.com'
});
store.dispatch({type: 'CLIENT_CREATED', payload: client});
```

In the Shopify buy SDK example, there are a few async calls to get information
about the products and store information in React‚Äôs `componentWillMount()`
function. That code looks like this:

```javascript
componentWillMount() {
    this.props.client.checkout.create().then((res) => {
      this.setState({
        checkout: res,
      });
    });

    this.props.client.product.fetchAll().then((res) => {
      this.setState({
        products: res,
      });
    });

    this.props.client.shop.fetchInfo().then((res) => {
      this.setState({
        shop: res,
      });
    });
  }
```

I opted to do that instead as far upstream as possible, directly in `index.js`.
Then, I issued a corresponding event when each part of the response has been
received:

```javascript
// buildClient() is synchronous, so we can call all these after!
client.product.fetchAll().then((res) => {
  store.dispatch({type: 'PRODUCTS_FOUND', payload: res});
});
client.checkout.create().then((res) => {
  store.dispatch({type: 'CHECKOUT_FOUND', payload: res});
});
client.shop.fetchInfo().then((res) => {
  store.dispatch({type: 'SHOP_FOUND', payload: res});
});
```

By now the reducer is created, and the initialization of the Shopify API
`client` is complete all for`index.js`.

#### Back to `App.js`

Now in `App.js`, wire up Redux‚Äôs store to the App state:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
```

and don‚Äôt forget to import the store as well:

```javascript
import store from './store';
```

At the bottom where `export default App` should be, modify it to this:

```javascript
export default connect((state) => state)(App);
```

This connects the redux state to the `App` component.

Now in the `render()` function we are able to access the Redux‚Äôs state with
Redux‚Äôs `getState()` (as apposed to using vanilla react‚Äôs `this.state`):

```javascript
render() {
    ...    
    const state = store.getState();
}
```

#### Finally: the Event Handlers (Still in App.js)

From above, you know that there are only three event handlers that we need in
`App.js`, because the cart uses only three: `updateQuantityInCart`,
`removeLineItemInCart`, and `handleCartClose`. The original cart event handlers
from the example GitHub repository, which used local component state looked like
this:

```javascript
updateQuantityInCart(lineItemId, quantity) {
  const checkoutId = this.state.checkout.id
  const lineItemsToUpdate = [{id: lineItemId, quantity: parseInt(quantity, 10)}]

return this.props.client.checkout.updateLineItems(checkoutId, lineItemsToUpdate).then(res => {
    this.setState({
      checkout: res,
    });
  });
}

removeLineItemInCart(lineItemId) {
  const checkoutId = this.state.checkout.id

return this.props.client.checkout.removeLineItems(checkoutId, [lineItemId]).then(res => {
    this.setState({
      checkout: res,
    });
  });
}

handleCartClose() {
  this.setState({
    isCartOpen: false,
  });
}
```

We can refactor them to dispatch events to the Redux store as follows:

```javascript
updateQuantityInCart(lineItemId, quantity) {
    const state = store.getState(); // state from redux store
    const checkoutId = state.checkout.id
    const lineItemsToUpdate = [{id: lineItemId, quantity: parseInt(quantity, 10)}]
    state.client.checkout.updateLineItems(checkoutId, lineItemsToUpdate).then(res => {
      store.dispatch({type: 'UPDATE_QUANTITY_IN_CART', payload: {checkout: res}});
    });
}
removeLineItemInCart(lineItemId) {
    const state = store.getState(); // state from redux store
    const checkoutId = state.checkout.id
    state.client.checkout.removeLineItems(checkoutId, [lineItemId]).then(res => {
      store.dispatch({type: 'REMOVE_LINE_ITEM_IN_CART', payload: {checkout: res}});
    });
}
handleCartClose() {
    store.dispatch({type: 'CLOSE_CART'});
}
handleCartOpen() {
    store.dispatch({type: 'OPEN_CART'});
}
```

You can add these between the `constructor()` and `render()` methods as usual.

If you were following along, I already mentioned that I added my own
`handleCartOpen` function, because I pass that function down as a prop to my
`<Nav/>` component, so a user is able to open and close the cart from a link in
the nav. At a future time, I could move that function to the Nav itself instead
of passing it as a prop, since of course the Redux store will also be avaliable
there!

#### Finally Add that Products Component!

So, you‚Äôve got a basic store maybe with some simple `href`‚Äôs that link to the
corresponding product on your Shopify store? Ha! Throw those out, and replace
them with your brand spankin‚Äô new `<Products/>` component!

First, import the component into wherever your store markup should be (remember,
in my code base I‚Äôve put the shopify example components in a folder called
`shopify/`)

This will be where ever your products currently are. (In[ the boilerplate
repository](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/react-redux-shopify-storefront-api-example)
I made, I put this in the `GenericProductsPage` component, to signal that this
code could be applied to any page that has a products section):

```javascript
import Products from './shopify/Products';
```

Now finally, that past 15‚Äì20 minutes of redux boilerplate code edits pays off:
we can grab the `products` component of our state ‚Äî not from a vanilla React
state passed down over and over again through props ‚Äî but through grabbing it in
a neat one liner `const state = store.getState();`:

```javascript
render () {
const state = store.getState(); // state from redux store
let oProducts = <Products
  products={state.products}
  client={state.client}
  addVariantToCart={this.addVariantToCart}
/>;
```


Don‚Äôt forget to drop the component itself into where it should go in your
`render()` function. For me, that location was buried in Bootstrap style classes
and HTML:

```javascript
...
<div className="service-content-one">
    <div className="row">
        <Products/>
    </div>{/*/.row*/}
</div>{/*/.service-content-one*/}
...
```

Finally, we will need a single event function `addVariantToCart` for the cart to
work with this products component. Again, for reference, here is the original,
vanilla React local `state` version of `addVariantToCar`(again, from the shopify
example repository):

```javascript
addVariantToCart(variantId, quantity){
  this.setState({
    isCartOpen: true,
  });

const lineItemsToAdd = [{variantId, quantity: parseInt(quantity, 10)}]
const checkoutId = this.state.checkout.id

return this.props.client.checkout.addLineItems(checkoutId, lineItemsToAdd).then(res => {
    this.setState({
      checkout: res,
    });
  });
}
```

and the new, Redux-friendly `store.dispatch()` version:

```javascript
addVariantToCart(variantId, quantity) {
    const state = store.getState(); // state from redux store
    const lineItemsToAdd = [{variantId, quantity: parseInt(quantity, 10)}]
    const checkoutId = state.checkout.id
    state.client.checkout.addLineItems(checkoutId, lineItemsToAdd).then(res => {
      store.dispatch({type: 'ADD_VARIANT_TO_CART', payload: {isCartOpen: true, checkout: res}});
    });
}
```

which is of course the one we will use üòÑ

don‚Äôt forget to bind it in the constructor:

```javascript
this.addVariantToCart = this.addVariantToCart.bind(this);
```

Don‚Äôt forget, you‚Äôll need to connect this component to the store like you did
`App.js` , and import the store:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import store from '../store';
```

at the top, and (assuming the component where you put the Shopify `Product`
component name is `GenericProductPage`:

```javascript
export default connect((state) => state)(GenericProductsPage);
```

at the bottom.

Great! Now, no matter how deep in components or where ever your products
component is declared, it can communicate with the cart‚Äôs state!

#### Final BONUS Example: Cart in Your Header or Nav

If you want to have a ‚ÄòCart‚Äô button in your header / nav, add this button in
your Nav component‚Äôs render function (again, an example from my current site,
which has Bootstrap styles ‚Äî a very simple version is in the [boilerplate
example](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/react-redux-shopify-storefront-api-example):

```javascript
<div className="App__view-cart-wrapper">
<button className="App__view-cart" onClick={this.props.handleCartOpen}>
    Cart
    </button>
</div>
```

where `handleCartOpen` is a new handler method you‚Äôll have to add to `App.js`:

```javascript
this.handleCartOpen = this.handleCartOpen.bind(this);
```

in the constructor. Then when you are referencing your Nav component in App.js
(or wherever you place your Nav) you pass the function handler:

```javascript
<Nav handleCartOpen={this.handleCartOpen}/>
```

#### Styling Component(s)

I relied on the CSS file, `app.css`, located in the`shared/` folder in th e
`storefront-api-example` repository (you can‚Äôt miss it, it‚Äôs the only file in
`shared/` ! Make sure to copy that into your `styles/` folder or wherever it
needs to be and include it in your `index.js`file. In my `index.js` it looks
like this:

```javascript
import './styles/shopify.css';
```

Since I renamed the `app.css` which was in the Shopify example repository to
`shopify.css` , and put it folder `styles`. This convention is also used in the
boilerplate repository code.

From here it‚Äôs pretty easy to identify where exactly in `shopify.css` the
default bright blue color for the buttons is defined, and so on. I‚Äôm going to
save detailed CSS customization for you to handle. üòÉ

But who knows, maybe I‚Äôll post on that eventually ‚Äî but I find the styles from
Shopify pretty good and easy enough to modify.

#### Takeaways

In my opinion, this is a perfect (non-todo list üòú) use of Redux. Redux cleanly
organizes the event functions and state of the Shopify cart and makes it easy to
access the cart‚Äôs state from any other component. This is much easier to
maintain than passing pieces of state to children and using multiple event
handlers to pass events back up to parent functions all over a React app.

As shown as an example in the tutorial, the cart‚Äôs state is accessed easily in
the nav component and the shop section of the front page. I‚Äôll also be able to
easily add it to a sort of ‚Äòfeatured‚Äô product section as well, once we‚Äôre ready
for that.

#### Find the Code

A boilerplate repository of this implementation [can be found
here](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/react-redux-shopify-storefront-api-example).
It is a near blank create-react-app app, but with all the changes of this
tutorial implemented in `index.js` and `App.js` , as well as a super basic
`GenericStorePage` and `Nav` components.

I built the code on the repo while re-reading and updating my own tutorial here,
to make sure this tutorial makes sense.

Because I am crazy üòú, Siren Apparel‚Äôs website is all open-sourced. So if you
want to fool around with my implementation, [check out the
respository!](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/sirenapparel.us)

I hope you enjoyed this tutorial! If anything isn‚Äôt clear or just plain not
working, let me know! I‚Äôll try to assist you!

Thanks to [Lisa Catalano](http://css-snippets.com/author/lisa/) at CSS-Snippets
