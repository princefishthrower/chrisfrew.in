## Today is the exact Birthday Date of my Blog!

If you go to my very first post, my 'Hello World - My First Post' post - you'll see the date is the 12th of December 2017 üòä 

(You may have also noticed I silently added some nice filter functionality to the site - I figured mostly devs are probably visiting my site, and don't want to always see my life and random rants / ideas mixed in.) So to see that 'Hello World' post, you'll need to click either the 'all' or 'blog' tag, and scroll all the way down.

Anyway, as a celebration, I built out a stats page for the blog, found at [https://chrisfrew.in/stats](https://chrisfrew.in/stats). (There will also now be a permanent blog ) This will be a data dump of blog posts per year, both from Gatsby GraphQL queries, and a postgresql database (which keeps track of all those nice :star:stars:star: you've all been giving me!). For now, this page will just have blog posts per month, stars per post, and similar. We'll see if I can get more creative ideas with it in the future.

Thats all for now!

Cheers! üç∫
