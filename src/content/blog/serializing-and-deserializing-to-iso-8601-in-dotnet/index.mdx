_ðŸ¥§ obligatory pie emoji for Pi day pun - all nerds unite!_

Recently I had to build an endpoint where a datetime would be passed in from the frontend and would have to be retrieved later. This is a super thing in API design, but I was running into an overload of ways to do it in .NET. I knew by best practices that I should be forming the actual `DateTime` objects with UTC time, and then serializing them to a string according to the ISO 8601 standard. 

The possibilities and combinations of parameters seemed endless, and I was seeing a variety of answers. Should I use:

- `ToString()`?
- `Convert.ToDateTime()`?
- `DateTime.Parse()`?

It was only after some significant trial and error that I got to the final solution as presented here, and it's something I don't remember learning about in the common tutorials about C# and .NET when I was first learning about them.

## `DateTime` to `string` and back Again, a Hobbit's Tale

I recommend the following. Given a variable of type `DateTime`:

```csharp
var myDatetime = DateTime.UtcNow;
```

### `DateTime` to `string`

When we want to form an ISO 8601 `string` from a `DateTime`, we should use `ToString("o")`:

```csharp
var myDatetimeIsoString = myDatetime.ToString("o");
// "2022-03-14T15:21:41.227Z"
```

Where the ["o" format specifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings#Roundtrip) tells C# to use the round-trip format (why this is not default, I don't know!)

### `string` to `DateTime`

When we want to go back to the exact representation of that `string` to `DateTime`, we should use `DateTime.Parse`:

```csharp
var myDatetimeAgain = DateTime.Parse(myDatetimeIsoString, null, System.Globalization.DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind);
```

Here, `null` is for the culture, and the third parameter is the 'kind', which of course we want as the `RoundtripKind`.

## In Summary

Using `ToString("o")` and `DateTime.Parse()`, you can convert between `string `to `DateTime`, over and over again and can be sure you'll never lose information or find them to be unequal! Perfect.

## Test It!

Nowadays, I almost feel like I can't write any code without having a test to confirm it. It helps me design my systems and gives me reassurance whenever I do any renames or refactors.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		var myDateTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
		var myDateTimeIsoString = myDateTime.ToString("o");
		var myDateTimeAgain = DateTime.Parse(myDateTimeIsoString, null, System.Globalization.DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind);
		
		// Doesn't throw :)
		Debug.Assert(myDateTime == myDateTimeAgain);
	}
}
```

Here's a [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/WlV6S3) if you want to run this yourself.

## This is the Way

Using this method (and our test to confirm it) you are sure your API deals with UTC `Datetime`s only, and that they can always be properly converted to the ISO 8601 datetime string, and subsequently to xthe correct timezone in your various clients, no matter where (and when ðŸ˜„) they may be around the world.

## Thanks!

Hope you enjoyed this post and that it saves you from scratching your head in the innumerable ways of converting `DateTime` to `string` in C# (and vice versa).
