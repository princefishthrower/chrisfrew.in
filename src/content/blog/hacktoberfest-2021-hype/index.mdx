Well, Hacktoberfest 2021 starts tomorrow. 

I was looking around the socials: on dev.to, Twitter, Instagram... and I gotta say...

![Huh? Where's the hype?!](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pz6535xfzw2ctriedv3e.gif)

It's a graveyard out there! (Pun totally intended.) There's nearly no discussion or hype for Hacktoberfest, and it starts TOMORROW!

While I expect a lot more discussion and excitement tomorrow, it can't hurt to start the discussion off a bit early, right? So... here's what I got!

## react-use-please-stay

I have a fun and simple React hook called `usePleaseStay` that helps you animate your favicon and title like so:

![usePleaseStay() example](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tahicwqwqwomv3f8c2io.gif)

The repository is [`react-use-please-stay`](https://github.com/princefishthrower/react-use-please-stay) on GitHub.

I've opened a few possible [issues](https://github.com/princefishthrower/react-use-please-stay/issues) that I think could be further optimizations to this hook! I hope you'll consider taking a look at them or tackling one!

Hope to see you all out there this October on the front lines of open source software! Have fun!
