# Laptop Stickers!

![So hipster. Much win. Yes.](./laptopstickers1.jpg)

Nothing shows others better that you are a humble, totally epic developer, than putting really cheap stickers on your really expensive laptop!

(Okay, I can't be _that_ humble since I'm bragging about a few 50&cent; stickers on a blog - and I'm even wrong on a second account - my Mac here is used, from 2013, and only set me back about $700 üòä)

# Tech stack

Okay, I'm lying; there are a few stickers there of tools I haven't used in one of my applications yet, but am learning and plan to very soon:

- Redux
- TypeScript
- ReactiveX

Otherwise, it's my honest-to-goodness workflow tools.

# So You Wanna Be Cool Too, Eh?

I ordered all of these on [redbubble.com](https://redbubble.com) No, no, it's not what you think, its not an affiliate link! In fact, a good start portal for RedBubble is [devstickers.com](https://devstickers.com). Unfortunately, I found I often had to find the 4-per-page stickers in order to have a sticker size that was suitable for me, _obviously_ so I could fit as many dev stickers as possible on my laptop üòÇ - see the picture for reference.

_(Update as of March 16, 2018 - I just couldn't resist buying more, and because of the multi-sticker / size of sticker struggles I had above, I ended up creating my own sticker sheet! (I wanted a weird mishmash of stickers for my development interests - spanning from perl to raiblocks to solidity - I know, weird) You can snag the same exact sticker sheet (I found the 'medium' sized sheet to produce the stickers with the best size for a laptop) [https://www.redbubble.com/people/chrisfrewin/works/30313316-dev-stickers?p=sticker&size=small&size=medium](https://www.redbubble.com/people/chrisfrewin/works/30313316-dev-stickers?p=sticker&size=small&size=medium) *Disclaimer: that is indeed my product on RedBubble!_

Here's how my mac looks now:

Yep, lots of tools.

Cheers! üç∫
