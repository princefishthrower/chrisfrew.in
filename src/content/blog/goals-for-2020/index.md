Though it's only the second year of doing this, I really enjoy this yearly review and will likely be doing it for the forseeable coming years. Since I have my (one) past post, let's review my progress from 2019 first:

## 2019: Software Engineering and Career Goals
- Learn Typescript and incorporate it into my personal stack of choice 

:white_check_mark: Done. I've learned TypeScript. However, I admit I 'cheat' by continuing to work in node projects that I started in normal JavaScript, which doesn't help my case. For example this blog isn't TypeScript yet. (I need to upgrade the gatsby version anyway, I think I'm like one whole major version behind). I say it with a bit of apprehension, but any future projects that I do with node, I pledge to do what would be the JavaScript parts with TypeScript.

- Find a paying freelance employer or project 

:white_check_mark: Technically acheived through SkillShare. Read on to learn more about my course situation and further goals for courses / tutorials in 2020.

- Finally build a profitable side hustle! 

:white_check_mark: Also technically done through SkillShare?

- Earn at least $1000 through my Skillshare course(s) 

:x: Total fail! I only earned about \$100 or so, but that's my own fault - I only made one course the whole year! Still, \$100 itself is certainly nothing to dismiss.

## 2019: Miscellaneous Goals
 - Read more.

:white_check_mark: For 2019, 'Read more' was also achieved, but my actual numerical goal to read 30 books was a total fail. I only managed 14. For 2020 I've made the same goal of 30 books. I'm trying harder this year to achieve it - though it really _is_ quite a lot - nearly 3 books per month! Whew! :sweat_smile:

Somehow it took the whole 2019 to get my reading muscles back - but I'm sitting strong here in mid-January already having finished my first book last week and halfway done with two more (that's right, I'm multitasking with two completely different books!!!)

- Paint more

:x: This one also was a fail. I made only 2 paintings in 2019, HOWEVER, I really got into digital print making and photography which I continue to work on now. Art is art right? No matter what form?

- Record and publish at least 2 songs 

:x: Total fail. Though even here I'm gonna take out only a share of the blame. My buddy, with whom I was _supposed_ to finish a pop-punk EP with _years_ ago, has decided he wants to get his M.S. degree... _while_ working a full time job. I mean, achievement, degrees, psh what the heck are those? Lets finish that EP!

- Run a marathon 

:x: Fail. (Though I did do a 50km / 7000 Hm hike this year, so I'll write it off as 1/2 fail - I also did two half marathons)

- More winter hiking/ski touring (this may seem like a random one, but I realized in all of 2018 I used my snowshoes twice for two winter hikes… granted, I went skiing a lot as well last year, but, I mean, I live in Austria, there is really no excuse not to be out and about in the mountains on the weekend, including hiking!)

:white_check_mark: Definitely got this one in 2019, and hopefully there will be even more winter trips in 2020, since I've planned some more ski tours and even some mountain hut overnighters!

# Goals for 2020

Not including what I mentioned above (many are extensions from 2019) there are some new goals I think are manageable for 2020. 

As I did for 2019, I will separate my goals for 2020 first listing my 'Software Engineering and Career Goals' and then my 'Miscellaneous Goals'.

## 2020: Software Engineering and Career Goals

- Work 'for the man' less - maybe even 'work' less

What I mean by this one is not working all the time for projects I get payed for directly on a contract or hourly basis. In 2019, due to a monster project, I experienced far too many 10-12 hour days which left me with no brain capacity left to work on producing other things I care about - such as opensource projects, my education and tutorial software courses, and just plain hacking for fun. 

I'm in a point in my career where I know enough to share my skills and work on more diverse projects. I just have to finally say enough is enough and take charge of what I want to produce out of my career. I understand there is a high demand for software developers who can get the job done, but there comes a point where I have to fix the balance of projects I work on. I have to take some time for myself and produce what I think is valuable. 2020 is that year.

- Make more software engineering tutorial videos and blog posts

Really just an extension of the above goal, but I want to name it explicitly for 2020, because I neglected both in 2019. As a corollary to this goal, I want to expand my courses outside of SkillShare. Too often I see a head scratcher solution on stack overflow, checked as the 'correct' solution, just because yes, it _answers_ the problem itself and works, but its not a true _solution_. Or, even worse, its a question that is simply left ignored. What I hope to bring to my courses is much more than just a coding play-by-play, but _explaining_ the steps I am taking and the reasoning behind what I am doing. I think those are the true insights and helpful points that courses provide; much more so than anything that could be rote-memorized from what I code.

## 2020: Miscellaneous Goals

- Improve cooking skills 

This one shouldn't be too hard - I have some basic skills in the kitchen and have a decent number of go to recepies based on what is in our pantry / fridge. For 2020, I'm talking about expanding into things like self-created sauces, more dynamic recipes such as using different oven functions and pan techniques, and using more diverse ingredients in whatever I create. 

As a very early 2020 update, I can say that already I've made some amazing oven-baked chicken and a feta-arugala-almond toasted sandwhich! (A quick and random hint - find recipes that use the broiling function on your oven - it opens a whole new world of recipes that you thought only the pros could do!)

- Homebrew an _amazing_ beer

My girlfriend and I have brewed 5 batches of beer since 2016. They were all _decent_ beers, and actually the latest one was closer to the _great_ side, but in my opinion none have been totally _amazing_. In 2020, I want to homebrew a beer where I (and others) can say, "Wow! _You_ actually brewed that?!" In other words, I want our own tasty homebrew beer to be indistinguishable from that of a well respected brewery.

Well that's it. 2019 was a _really_ hard year with that project I mentioned - it was easily the hardest project I've ever did (even more so than my [master's thesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010218016302279)) in terms of length and arduous labor. But out of it came a huge learning experience that was all about the Magento 2 framework, and of course I have the added benefit of being able to add that project to my portfolio. It's certainly a project I won't forget.

-Cheers! :beer:
