To anyone who may visit my blog more often than just finding it's results through google, I have to extend a small apology. 

I've totally neglected the ability to subscribe here! While the current system it's always been running fine for _existing subscribes_, the form itself has been missing since sometime in 2019 when I totally revamped the blog, taking out the email subscription form. It's back now! 

Simply scroll all the way down to check it out - and of course, consider subscribing. :wink:

*I'm also working on putting the old star functionality back in as well (inspired by [Seth's Blog](https://seths.blog/)).

Welp, that's all for now!

Cheers! :beer:
