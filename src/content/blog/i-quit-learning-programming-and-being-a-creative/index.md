# What's the point?

I had a sudden epiphany today. 

All this extra learning in the directions of software engineering, upping my graphic design and vector graphic game in [learning how to make screen prints](https://www.behance.net/chrisfrewin), making iOS apps, fiddling with [options and investing](https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-9a018f11f69e), learning new programming languages and paradigms, it's all a waste of time! It's just too much effort. 

What do I get? Self satisfaction? More job opportunities? A daily challenge? Surely _those_ are things that _nobody_ wants to have! Just stress! Just _more_ work piled on top of work!

I'm just gonna get my snug 40 hour a week job and call it a day. No more self-development, just buy a house, move in, and work that 9-5 for the rest of my days. You win life. I'm out.

# My Resolve

So, I can hear you nearly closing your tab (if you haven't already) rolling your eyes, and sighing, saying something like _this loser - it's just a blog_ . However, there _is_ something that affects _you_. In light of my lifestyle change,

***I won't be making any more Skillshare videos, any more art prints, or programming a single line ever again.***

# A Scrap of Good News

Sorry if I've offended you in this post, but there's even better news:

this is an April fool's post. :joy:

Oh, it's also my birthday (NOT an April fools joke = trust me I've heard that one just a few times :wink:). 

I'm 27. And old. :skull:

:beer: Cheers!
