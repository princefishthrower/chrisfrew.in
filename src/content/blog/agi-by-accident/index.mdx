In a 2023 Lex Friedman podcast, [John Carmack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4), often regarded as one of the best programmers alive, claimed t

This got me thinking about [The Library of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel), a short story by Jorge Luis Borges.

People spend their lives pouring over the books, looking for meaning in the endless sea of gibberish.

**I think AI is going to be the same way.**

Not that it is totally useless, but the fast problem space that is grappling with reality can not be simply "solved" by something aliterated as "AGI". Every single human is an AGI, and we are all still trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

I took a rather large typescript file I was working on and check the number of unique characters in the file.

If you're curious what that script was:

```bash
tr -d '\n' < <yourtypescriptfilehere>.ts | grep -o . | sort -u | wc -l
```

I arrived at 74 unique characters, though I realized that certain characters, like capital "Y" and "Z" were never used. Though not much of a matter

Really, this is just a permutation problem. We have 75 characters, and we want to arrange them in 10,000 lines.
