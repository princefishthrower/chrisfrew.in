Because I don't really care if this gets taken down at this point - I'm sick of seeing far less data based analysis being hailed and coveted around the world - when it's all just a bunch of trash.

Let's take the United States as a starting example. From the onset of the pandemic, the lowest case rate per week has been around 150,000 infects per week, or about 20,000 per day. Let's just take those numbers as the most conservative base rate. At that rate, it would take about 44 years, or in 2065, that the number of infections would reach that of the current population of the United States. This date would likely be later, as the U.S. population is project to increase, and (hopefully) vaccination rates continue to rise.

But as the overwhelming majority (98%+) of new corona virus casus are taken on by those who are unvaccinated, it's only a matter of time _until every single person on the planet has antibodies to COVID-19 - whether through vaccination or exposure._ Ok, that is, unless you live in something resembling a nuclear fallout shelter and never associate with anyone ever. Then you're safe.

I would argue that future rules should start shifting to looking at antibodies

For a better overview of the actual dangers to society, we would need:

1. How many of 'positive' tests are assiciated with actual - regardless of vaccination status

So. What shall we do?

From the data I've seen, many more people have been infected with COVID than are reported on the precious data dashboards used by Johns hopkins, the New York Times and others.

In statistics that just came out yesterday from the [UK's Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19/latestinsights#antibodies), 94.9% of adults in England have COVID-19 antibodies.

At some point, the harsh rules have to stop in countries which have offered the vaccine for free. At some point, you have to accept that anyone who could have wanted to be vaccinated could have been, and those who still - just as we do with every other vaccine that's ever existed or been created. They offer only protection, not invicibility.

Just trying to bring a more common sense view to a topic I've really gotten sick of after 2+ years of high noise, low signal ranting and raving.
