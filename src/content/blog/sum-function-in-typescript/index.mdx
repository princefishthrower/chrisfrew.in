## Creating a Simple Sum Function in TypeScript

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to create a straightforward sum function in TypeScript. Follow along to understand the process and enhance your TypeScript skills.

## Function Signature

Let's start with the signature of the function:

```typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {

};
```

## Add JS Doc Comment
For better documentation, let's add a short JSDoc comment to the function:

```typescript

/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @param a The first number to add.
 * @param b The second number to add.
 */
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {

};
```

## Implement the Function Body

Now, let's add the body of the function. For this simple function, we'll use the built-in 'plus' operator to return the sum of a and b:

```typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

## Refactoring - Implicit Return
For a concise and readable code, we can use an implicit return for a single-line arrow function. Remove the curly braces and 'return' keyword:

```typescript
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
```

This is called an implicit return, making the code shorter and more readable.

## Conclusion

And that's it! You've successfully created a simple sum function in TypeScript!
