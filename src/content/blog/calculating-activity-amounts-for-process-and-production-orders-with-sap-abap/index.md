_Edit June 1st, 2018:_

_There was ANOTHER issue with this code! There is something you need to add if you want to book custom goods movements for the retrograde materials. You can see how to do this in <a href="#footnote-6">footnote 6</a> for more._

_Edit April 19th, 2018:_

_There was a bug with this code! When we make the conversion to MIN, we forgot to overwrite_ `lv_unit` _to_ `MIN`_, so the conversion was correct, but the unit was left in hours, or_ `H` _! You can see this in the code comments with date 2018.04.19._

# First off, Congratulations! :confetti_ball:
<sup>And a happy new year! (If you're viewing this in the summer or something, see the date! 😉)</sup>
## You've found the only post on the entire internet that describes the full process of calculating activity amounts for production order confirmations by programming it directly using SAP ABAP! :scream::scream::scream:
## I hope you use this post to maximum effectiveness, because it took me _four_ days to find, build, and get a working answer. 😊

## The Problem

Let's jump right into ABAP programming: the go-to function module to calculate time ticket proposals for production orders is with function module `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP`:

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'
* EXPORTING
*   PROPOSE                  = ' '
* IMPORTING
*   RETURN                   =
  TABLES
    timetickets              =
*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =
*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =
*   DETAIL_RETURN            =
          .
```

Likewise, there is a very similiar `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP` for process orders:

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'
* EXPORTING
*   PROPOSE                  = ' '
* IMPORTING
*   RETURN                   =
  TABLES
    timetickets              =
*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =
*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =
*   DETAIL_RETURN            =
          .
```

Pretty similar. However, as part of my indentured servitude that is being a full-time employee, I spent a day tinkering, writing, and testing code with these function modules. No matter what combinations of inputs I provided, I couldn't get the _activity confirmation amount_ to be calculated, which are a very important part of the final calculation of the confirmation! (more on the actual final confirmation submission is also included in later on) From scrounging around on SCN and the SAP blog, I learned that many developers had the same issue with these functions. (Things like date, yield/scrap amounts, and the goods movements would be proposed just fine by these BAPIs.)

So, **calculating these activity confirmation amounts programmatically (in ABAP) will be the main focus of this post <sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.**

Unfortunately, with much more digging, the reason the two functions wouldn't produce activity confirmation amounts never became quite clear to me. I realized I would have to calculate them in a more manual manner and then add them to those BAPI structures `lt_timetickets` manually.

## The Calculation Function Module

Through SAP GUI in transaction `CO11N`, determining system-proposed confirmation amounts is easy enough by and asking the system to do the calculation for us <sup><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>. My struggle was finding the programmatic way to do this in ABAP.

Anyone with significant production planning experience (i.e., not me 😂 ) knows that the actual formula behind the activity calculation is not with the activity itself, but with the work center _behind_ the activity <sup><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>.

In transaction `CR03` (display work center), in the 'Costing' Tab, there is a 'Formula' button with the check symbol on it:

![GUI testing calculation](./test-formula.jpg)

This was my starting point to find any sort of function that could do this programmatically - with more time, I learned from SCN of a function that does exactly that! It's called `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`!

Let's head on over to transaction `SE37` and test it ourselves!

![Yep, that's SAP](./error-test-frame.jpg)

:expressionless::expressionless::expressionless: shit... SAP, you had one job to do!

Fine. We'll do it ourselves. We can open up the source code of `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` and set a breakpoint in the first line:

![The first possible line in the function we can breakpoint](./function-breakpoint.png)

and in CR03, drag our [debugging shortcut into the calculation window](https://chrisfrew.in/blog/debugging-abap-with-sap-shortcut), and we press return SAP debugging's return button to jump out to whatever parent program is calling this function... <img src="return.png"/> and...

:pray: Violá! :pray: We've found where `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` is called out in the wild!

![There you are `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`](./function-found.png)

(For those deeply interested, you can find exactly where the function is called in SAP Program `SAPLCRA0`, Include `LCRA0F71`, line 55, at least for SAPGUI 740.)

## The Details (The Hard Part)

So what the heck does SAP do with this function? Well, first, they are doing a do loop six times. Aha, we know why - because there can be a total of six confirmation values <sup><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>  - SAP is by default looping over all of them.

Now for the function parameters themselves: they pass the work center code (`arbid`), the operation number (`rcrop`), the index of the confirmation (a value of 1-6), our 4 default values (`vgw`), and the date (`date`).

In turn, the function spits out the fixed value amount of the activity calculation (`value_fix`), the variable part (`value_var`), both in whatever unit the function gives out in `unit`, and `co_a` is for the cost center accounting <sup><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>. There are actually four exceptions to this function, so I'm not sure why SAP internal is taking only two of them. In any case, there are other `IMPORTING` and `EXPORTING` parameters in the function signature, but this looks like a good starting point as a minimum. In fact, as you'll see below, the final working version of the code I created is almost exactly the same except where I found out with a bit of playing around.

So I mentioned the default values that must go into `vgw` - these are the four values that are the equivalent of those four fields we can type into in `COR3` for checking the formula, things like setup time, machine time, personnel setup, and personnel time. It might sound like a lot of work to hunt down these values, but luckily these are master data and can be determined with a few select statements, first from table `AFVC` 'operation within an order', and then table `PLPO` 'task list - operation/activity':

```abap
" this is the full key for table AFVC - operation within an order - for the routing number and counter - should always work with SELECT SINGLE
SELECT SINGLE * FROM afvc INTO ls_afvc
  WHERE aufpl = ls_operation-routing_no
  AND   aplzl = ls_operation-counter.

" this is the full key for table PLPO - task list - operation/activity - so it should always work with SELECT SINGLE
SELECT SINGLE * FROM plpo INTO ls_plpo
  WHERE plnty EQ ls_afvc-plnty
  AND plnnr EQ ls_afvc-plnnr
  AND plnkn EQ ls_afvc-plnkn
  AND zaehl EQ ls_afvc-zaehl.
```

The routing number `ls_operation-routing_no` and counter `ls_operation-counter` we've gotten from function `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`:

```abap
" need only the operations from the function
    ls_order_objects-operations = 'X'.
    lv_number = ls_orderid_so-low.

    CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL'
      EXPORTING
        number        = lv_number
*       COLLECTIVE_ORDER       =
        order_objects = ls_order_objects
*     IMPORTING
*       RETURN        =
      TABLES
*       HEADER        =
*       POSITION      =
*       SEQUENCE      =
        operation     = lt_operation
*       TRIGGER_POINT =
*       COMPONENT     =
*       PROD_REL_TOOL =
      .
```

(There is plenty of SAP standard documentation and discussion on SCN on how to use `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`, so I'll leave that to you if you need more info 😉. Here we are just getting the operation information from the order - that's all we need.)

We can finally move the corresponding fields of `ls_plpo` to `ls_vgw`:

```abap
MOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_vgw.
```

However, in addition to these four values, there are two more that are essential, that is the yield amount (`mgvrg`), and the unit (`meinh`)! We can pass them right into `ls_op` as well:

```abap
MOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_op.
ls_op-mgvrg = ls_yield_so-low.
ls_op-meinh = ls_conf_quan_unit_so-low.
```

Armed with our structures `ls_afvc`, `ls_op`, and `ls_vgw`, we are ready to call our function:

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC' " You can see a SAP standard example with the function in the source code for transaction CR03 for costing formula: Program SAPLCRA0, Include LCRA0F71, Form FORMEL_RESULT_CALC, line 55
  EXPORTING
    arbid             = ls_afvc-arbid
    op                = ls_op
    vgw               = ls_vgw
    index             = sy-index
    date              = sy-datum
  IMPORTING
    value_fix          = lv_value_fix
    value_var         = lv_value_var
    unit              = lv_unit
  EXCEPTIONS
    missing_parameter = 1
    not_found         = 2
    division_by_zero  = 3
    OTHERS            = 4.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.
  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.
ENDIF.
```

We want the total, right? Okay, we just add the fixed value and variable value part:

```abap
lv_value = lv_value_fix + lv_value_var. " total value is the sum of the fixed and variable values for this activity
```

A requirement by my company was to have all the activity confirmation values with the same unit (I find it cleaner anyway to have all the activity confirmation values in the same unit anyway). Unfortunately, the default unit for some of the activities was hours, so we have to take a small intermediary step and call a conversion function before we are truly done:

```abap
" convert any 'H' values to 'MIN'
IF lv_unit NE 'MIN'.
  CALL FUNCTION 'UNIT_CONVERSION_SIMPLE'
    EXPORTING
      input                = lv_value
      unit_in              = lv_unit
      unit_out             = 'MIN'
    IMPORTING
      output               = lv_output
    EXCEPTIONS
      conversion_not_found = 1
      division_by_zero     = 2
      input_invalid        = 3
      output_invalid       = 4
      overflow              = 5
      type_invalid         = 6
      units_missing        = 7
      unit_in_not_found    = 8
      unit_out_not_found   = 9
      OTHERS               = 10.
  IF sy-subrc <> 0.
    lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). " add custom message to message log
    CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.
    APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.
  ENDIF.
```
We then finally carry over this converted `lv_output` over to the `conf_activity` field for `lt_timetickets`, doing this for all 1-6 `conf_activity`'s:

```abap
CASE sy-index.
  WHEN 1.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity1  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit1 = 'MIN'.
  WHEN 2.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity2  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit2 = 'MIN'.
  WHEN 3.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity3  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit3 = 'MIN'.
  WHEN 4.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity4  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit4 = 'MIN'.
  WHEN 5.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity5  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit5 = 'MIN'.
  WHEN 6.
    ls_timetickets-conf_activity6  = lv_output.
    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit6 = 'MIN'.
ENDCASE.
```

With that, we can call the final confirmation function, with all our calculated values wrapped up in `lt_timetickets`:

```abap
" create confirmation
CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT'
*     EXPORTING
*       POST_WRONG_ENTRIES             = '0'
*       TESTRUN                        =
*       CALL_ON_INBOUND_QUEUE          = ' '
  IMPORTING
    return         = ls_return
  TABLES
    timetickets    = lt_timetickets
    goodsmovements = lt_goodsmovements
*       LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV             =
*       CHARACTERISTICS_WIPBATCH       =
*       LINK_CONF_CHAR_WIPBATCH        =
    detail_return  = lt_detail_return
*       CHARACTERISTICS_BATCH          =
*       LINK_GM_CHAR_BATCH             =
  EXCEPTIONS
    OTHERS         = 1.
IF sy-subrc <> 0.
  lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). " add custom message to message log
  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.
  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.
ENDIF.
```
If you were sharp, you realized all of this code is only on the operation level - so indeed, the six-level loop must be done each time, for each operation - we have to throw all the above code into a loop over our operations! See below for the full result!

## Production Orders
In summary, the full code looks like this:

**NOTE: the full code examples were written for a SAP Gateway environment - i.e. the server environment from a SAPUI5 OData call! If you try to copy and paste this code directly into something like a report or function, ABAP statements like:**

```abap
lt_filters = io_tech_request_context->get_filter( )->get_filter_select_options( ).
```

won't be in scope and won't compile without errors! However, if you are familiar with the CRUD based methods of the SAP Gateway backend, these will fit nicely into the `GET_ENTITYSET` method 😊

## Process Orders

Because SAP is ever-so-special, process orders have a slightly different program process due to a few name changes. Here is a summary of some of those name and type changes:

<hr/>

| Topic | Production Orders | Process Orders |
| ------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Name of the 'steps' in your process or production order | phase/activity (I've seen both names, ABAP uses mostly 'phase') | operation |
| Get order detail of order | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |
| detail of order 'step' type | `bapi_order_phase`  |  `bapi_order_operation1` |
| Function for timeticket proposals | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |
| Function for order confirmation | `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT` | `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT` |
| `timetickets` `TYPE` in order confirmation function | `bapi_pp_timeticket` | `bapi_pi_timeticket1` |

<hr/>

There are more, but you can find those in the code for yourself. The important thing to notice is that the key challenging part here, calculating the confirmation activity amounts, uses the same internal function module, ``

Here's the code for calculating activities for process orders - _note the slight change in all the variable names!_ - and be careful with your types (carefully look over the `DATA:` statement), otherwise you'll get :boom:**exploding runtime errors**:boom: when you try to confirm something with one of our two main functions and you pass, for example, the  `lt_timetickets` with the production type ``, and you pass it into the of the _process_ order function module.

## Final Comments

Whew. Did it feel like a marathon? :runner: Because it felt to _me_ like a marathon all that time I was scratching my head. I hope you all enjoyed and found this post useful for a not-so-often programmed function of this production planning section of SAP.

Another note and quick plug 😊 I hope everyone can appreciate the time I put into creating these posts (_hint:_ posts this long take a **LONG** time to write!). It would make me happy and give me the motivation to keep writing these detailed ABAP posts if you'd consider donating (in the footer of any page on this blog) I have a [PayPal.me link](https://www.paypal.me/chrisfrewin), and I'm also an Ethereum developer if you'd like to donate Ether or if you would like to donate some RaiBlocks, as I am a RaiBlocks enthusiast if you would prefer to donate in that way.

:poop: Ok, plug done! :poop:

Cheers! 🍺

# Footnotes

<div id="footnote-1">
1. Activities/phases are for production orders; Operations are for process orders. From this point onward, I will refer just to activities, since this post focuses on production orders. I also post the adjacent code for process orders in this post.
</div>

<div id="footnote-2">
2. I have to give credit where credit is due! I received a lot of assistance from our production planning module supervisor - he showed me the transactions that finally got me to a working result. :thumbsup:
</div>

<div id="footnote-3">
3. You can set up your production planning (PP) module to give you a proposal amount for the activities, directly when you are doing confirmations transaction <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">CO11N</span>:

Upon pressing 'enter' for with a new amount:
![Automatic calculation of confirmation activities by the System in transaction CO11N](./co11n-1.jpg)

Pressing 'OK' for this window, we get a popup:

![Filling confirmation activities by hand in transaction CO11N](./co11n-2.jpg)

We see that the Labor time is provided here. It's likely 30 min for a full 100 KG, since the system is proposing only 15 minutes for 50 KG, half of what the full order amount should be. (I know, it's not a full four field example - but values would also be proposed if you had more fields like machine time, machine set-up, etc.)
</div>

<div id="footnote-4">
4. Note: At my company, we usually use only up to four confirmation activities. Note that there can be up to six, but for this example, we'll say that the confirmation process has only a maximum of four.
</div>

<div id="footnote-5">
5. I ended up determining that you can exclude parameter `co_a` without any issues - however, this may be how the settings at my own company work - you can look deeper into the SAP example to include it.
</div>

<div id="footnote-6">
6. This issue does not affect the confirmation formulas, but rather the goods movements in the retrograde ingredients - specifically when the goods movements are to be overridden, for example with a batch split for a retrograde material, or a custom under- or over- amount of a retrograde material. For the rare case where an employee wanted to book some of our retrograde materials from various batch numbers and warehouse locations, they noticed in these custom goods movements with the confirmation were not being added; but rather always the default SAP-calculated amounts. After some head scratching, I found it all has to do with function module <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> (or <span style="font-family:'Courier New'">BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> depending on your use case) - I was not passing in an important parameter which allows exactly this desired override behavior:

<pre>
LinkConfGoodsmov
The assignment of the goods movements to a confirmation is effected
via the LinkConfGoodsmov table. There must be an entry in this table
for every entry in the Goodsmovements table. The index in the
LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line of the
associated confirmation in the Timetickets table and the index in
the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field refers the associated
goods movement in the Goodsmovements table.
If you want to prevent a goods movement from being posted for a
confirmation according to the standard logic, make an entry in the
LinkConfGoodsmov table as well as in the Timetickets table. The
index in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line
of the associated confirmation in the Timetickets table. Enter the
initial value 0 in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field. It is
not necessary to make an entry in the Goodsmovements table in this
case.
If there is no entry in the LinkConfGoodsmov table for a
confirmation, goods movements are determined for backflushing and
automatic goods receipt using the standard logic.
</pre>

We needed to add the following too our goods movements loop (already added in the code above! 😊):

BLAH
