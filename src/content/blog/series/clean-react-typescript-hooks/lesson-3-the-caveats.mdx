_Coming Soon_

<!-- Every abstraction has caveats right?

Unfortunately, react's very first example of `useEffect` looks something like this:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
    // some stuff in here, doesn't really matter what it is, 
    // read on to see why this will break your app
})
```

The hilarious thing is . Remember our 'values to watch' E and F? they're not included here - in fact, not even our empty array `[]` is present. 

**This is telling react to run this effect continuously. This is very bad, and will break your application.** -->
