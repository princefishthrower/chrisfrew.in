# It's My Birthday!

No, that's not an April Fool's joke, and yes, I've heard them all before, har, har, har üòë.

Anyway, I typically like to make a nice little blog post on my birthday. My previous birthday posts have included [a post about giving up as a creator and that I was shutting down the blog](https://chrisfrew.in/blog/i-quit-learning-programming-and-being-a-creative/) (which is obvious to see at this point _was_ an April Fool's joke).

# Colored Shell Prompts?! With¬†Emojis?!

Most of us devs know we can color our shell prompts with various colors, and in shell syntax it is some sort of ugly looking formatting string like `\e[31m` - that one is for the color red, which I'm sure you had memorized and knew right away, right? üòÇ

Well, I took a deep dive recently on the whole shell prompt formatting story recently, after creating my Full Stack Course "Bash Commands and Scripting - from Beginner to Expert":

All that aside, what if I told you that you could style your prompt in an advanced fashion, to make it look something like this:

or this:

or, my current setup, like this:

# The Repository

The [repository is here](https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors). There you'll find all the details about the actual color implementation and the steps you need to take to get these cool colors to show up in your shell!

As far as I know, I'm the first person to _ever_ have done this! (Or at least published it) üòé I know why now - because bash and zsh syntax makes creating such color patterns a massive headache! üòÖ

I believe I've saved you that headache by [creating a repository for the snippets](https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors) and have also pasted the code snippets below.

# The Code

The [repository is here](https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors). There you'll find all the details about the actual color implementation and the steps you need to take to get these cool colors to show up in your shell! For the impatient, a working script for both bash and zsh shells is below, but I can't promise that these following snippets are the most up-to-date versions.

## bash

```bash
function buildColorPrompt() {

    # I always like showing what directory I am in (special character "\w" in PS1) - store the equivalent in this 'directory' variable
    directory=$(pwd)

    # Modify these to whatever you'd like!
    PROMPT_TEXT="awesome-shell-prompt-colors@awesome-machine [$directory] "

    # Colors seperated by comma - acceptable values are:
    # black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, light gray, light red, light green, light yellow, light blue, light magenta, light cyan
    PROMPT_COLORS="red,white,blue"

    # Colors!
    BLACK="\e[30m"
    WHITE="\e[97m"
    RED="\e[31m"
    GREEN="\e[32m"
    YELLOW="\e[33m"

    # End formatting string
    END_FORMATTING="\[\e[0m\]"

    # split PROMPT_COLORS into array

        colors_array[$count]=$x
        ((count=count+1))

        # Determine color in this giant case statement
        color="${colors_array[color_index]}"

    # Finally: set the PS1 variable

## zsh

```bash
function buildColorPrompt() {

    # I always like showing what directory I am in
    directory=$(pwd)

    # Modify these to whatever you'd like!
    PROMPT_TEXT="youruser@yourmachine [$directory]"

    PROMPT_INPUT_COLOR="15"

    # split PROMPT_COLORS into array
    colors_array=("${(@s/,/)PROMPT_COLORS}") # @ modifier

    # break PROMPT_TEXT into character array

        # Determine color in this giant case statement
        color="${colors_array[color_index]}"

        # add to ps1 var - color, then letter, then the end formatter
        ps1+="%F{$color}${letters[$i]}"

    }

    # end color formating
    ps1+="%F{$PROMPT_INPUT_COLOR} %# "

    # Finally: set the PROMPT variable
    PROMPT=$ps1
}

# set the precmd() hook to our custom function
precmd() {
   buildColorPrompt;
}
```

You'll also find these snippets <Link to="/snippets">under the devops section of the snippets page.</Link>

Go ahead and paste these right into your `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile`, respectively, depending on what terminal you are using. Or, <a href="https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors">make a pull request on the repository to submit the code for a new shell!</a>

# Thanks!

That's all for now. I'm off to enjoy my birthday, but I may at some point write an additional post with a walkthrough of both functions - as it turns out, there are some annoying and interesting differences between bash and zsh - the most unforgivable is that loops in zsh start at 1 üôÑ.

Cheers! üç∫
