# It's My Birthday!

No, that's not an April Fool's joke, and yes, I've heard them all before, har, har, har 😑.

Anyway, I typically like to make a nice little blog post on my birthday. My previous birthday posts have included [a post about giving up as a creator and that I was shutting down the blog](https://chrisfrew.in/blog/i-quit-learning-programming-and-being-a-creative/) (which obvious to see at this point _was_ an April Fool's joke).

# Colored Shell Prompts

Most of us devs know we can color our shell prompts with various colors, and typically in shell syntax it is some sort of ugly looking formatting string like `\e[31m` - that one is for the color red, which I'm sure you knew right away, right? 😂

Well, I took a deep dive recently on the whole shell prompt formatting story recently, after creating my Full Stack Course "Bash Commands and Scripting - from Beginner to Expert":

All that aside, what if I told you that you could style your prompt in an advanced fashion, to make it look something like this:

or this:

or, my current setup, like this:

# The Code

The code [repository is here](https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors). There you'll find all the details about the actual color implementation and the steps you need to take to get these cool colors to show up in your shell!

# The Implementations

## bash

```bash
function buildColorPrompt() {

    # I always like showing what directory I am in (special character "\w" in PS1) - store the equivalent in this 'directory' variable
    directory=$(pwd)

    # Modify these to whatever you'd like!
    PROMPT_TEXT="awesome-shell-prompt-colors@awesome-machine [$directory] "

    # Colors seperated by comma - acceptable values are:
    # black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, light gray, light red, light green, light yellow, light blue, light magenta, light cyan
    PROMPT_COLORS="red,white,blue"

    # Colors!
    BLACK="\e[30m"
    WHITE="\e[97m"
    RED="\e[31m"
    GREEN="\e[32m"
    YELLOW="\e[33m"
    BLUE="\e[34m"
    MAGENTA="\e[35m"
    CYAN="\e[36m"
    LIGHT_GRAY="\e[37m"
    DARK_GRAY="\e[90m"
    LIGHT_RED="\e[91m"
    LIGHT_GREEN="\e[92m"
    LIGHT_YELLOW="\e[93m"
    LIGHT_BLUE="\e[94m"
    LIGHT_MAGENTA="\e[95m"
    LIGHT_CYAN="\e[96m"

    # End formatting string
    END_FORMATTING="\[\e[0m\]"

    # split PROMPT_COLORS into array
    count=0
    IFS=','
    for x in $PROMPT_COLORS
    do
        colors_array[$count]=$x

    for (( i=0 ; i < ${#letters[@]} ; i++ )) {
        # Determine color in this giant case statement
        color="${colors_array[color_index]}"
        case $color in

## zsh

```bash
function buildColorPrompt() {

    directory=$(pwd)

    # Modify these to whatever you'd like!
    PROMPT_TEXT="youruser@yourmachine [$directory]"

    PROMPT_COLORS="15"

    # This will be the color of everything in the input part of the prompt (here set to 15 = white)
    PROMPT_INPUT_COLOR="15"

    # split PROMPT_COLORS into array
    colors_array=("${(@s/,/)PROMPT_COLORS}") # @ modifier

    # break PROMPT_TEXT into character array

```

Go ahead and paste these right into your `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile`, respectively, depending on what terminal you are using. Or, <a href="https://github.com/princefishthrower/awesome-shell-prompt-colors">make a pull request on the repsoitory to submit the code for a new shell!</a>

# Thanks!

That's all for now. I'm off to enjoy my birthday, but I may improve this post with a walkthrough of both functions very soon - as it turns out, there are some annoying and interesting differences between bash and zsh - the most unforgivable that loops in zsh start at 1 🙄.

Cheers 🍺
