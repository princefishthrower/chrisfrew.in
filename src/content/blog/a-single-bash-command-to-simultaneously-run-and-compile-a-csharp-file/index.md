## Background: 2019 Advent of Code and Microsoft Troubles

I've started the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for this December! (This will be my first one - don't know how I've missed it in previous years!) Anyway, to get better at C#, which I may be using in the future for work, I decided to do all the Advent challenges in C#. 

That's when I realized I didn't know how to simply "run" a .cs script. With Python scripts we can simply use `python`, with Perl we have `perl`, and so on. 

Of course anything to do with Microsoft is _never_ straightforward :rolling_eyes:. Up till now, I had always just sat back complacently and let Visual Studio run the code for me simply via the 'run' button. But for these fun Advent scripts, I decided to just keep it simple with Visual Studio Code. 

## The Bash Alias
I wanted a simple way to simultaneously compile _and_ run my C# scripts, saving me from having to issue giant, or worse, _multiple_ Bash commands each time.

To achieve such a behavior we need just a few simple steps:
1. First, we must allow our bash function to accept a single argument: the filename of the desired `.cs` file to compile and run.
2. Compile that passed .cs file using `csc`, while also using the `-nologo` flag to suppress the annoying copyright and info that is normally posted.
3. Execute the .exe file generated by `csc`.

Steps 2 and 3 will need to parse the filename argument separately such that `csc` operates on the `.cs` file, and `mono` operates on the generated `.exe` file. 

I named my alias simply `cs`, since it will be used for .cs files exclusively. Here it is in its full 6 lines of glory:

```bash
# usage: cs <<FileName.cs>>
# output: any stdout as well as any effects produced from the executing the compiled C# script
function cs() {
    csc -nologo "${1%%.*}".cs;
    mono "${1%%.*}".exe;
}
```


I haven't tested it too extensively, but it's working for me as long as the script to be compiled has a `static main` method. (I think `csc` warns you or throws an error otherwise). Go ahead and copy that into your `.profile`, `.bashrc`, or similar, and get rippin' with C# scripts!
