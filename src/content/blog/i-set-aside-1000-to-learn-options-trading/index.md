Whew. It's been over a month since my last post! This is mainly because of some of the projects I've been working on; so rest assured there will be plenty of new content coming soon. (I've been improving my development arsenal with Redux (haven't had a need for it yet) and Redux Saga which leverages a lot of great JavaScript such as generator functions for async deliciousness, as well as joining a hackathon team to build a beerpong robot - but more of that in later posts.)

# Robinhood - Options! AHAHAHAH! Oh wait... my money is gone :sob::sob::sob:

Like many millennials will experience in the coming months, my options trading got unlocked on Robinhood. Robinhood is a commission free broker that initial started as a mobile-only (as far as I know Robinhood is only available for United States Citizens - sorry for everyone else - but options are definitely in the cards if you find the right broker!) Anyway, as I experiment with everything, why not also with options? What I've seen places for example like [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), options trading can be extremely lucrative, but highly risky. I wanted to learn what they were all about and if it would be indeed possible for me to make some sustainable income - not in a risky YOLO method, but a calculated method that follows mathematical principles.

# The Posts - on Medium

To spare you from more of my rambling, here's the very first post of the series:

I hope you enjoy watching me lose all my money! :joy:

Cheers! :beer:
