During my work at [InClub](https://inclub-app.com), I constructed a generic REST API helper function that we use all around our backend. So far, this function has worked for every type of HTTP call we've thrown at it. Some examples:

-   `POST`ing to [DeepL's translate text API](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/translate-text/)
-   `GET` / `POST` to [Instagram's Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)
-   `GET` / `POST` / `DELETE` to [Sendbird's Chat Platform API](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/platform-api/overview).

I figured I'd share this function with the world, as it's a great real-world example of how to use Go's generic capabilities. I'm going to do a full walk-through of how to build the function, but if you just want the function, hop down to the [full code snippet](#full-code-snippet).

For the rest of this post, I'll assume that we write the generic function in a package called `http_helper`. This is the name used in [the example repository](https://github.com/princefishthrower/golang-generic-http-helper-function.git).

## Getting Started - Function Signature

Let's start with a signature for the function. Let's name the function `MakeHTTPRequest`; that's pretty straightforward. This is a very flexible function, but as such we have a laundry list of parameters to accept:

- We'll need the desired endpoint, which we call `fullUrl`, type `string`
- I claim that we can handle `GET`s, `POST`s, and any other HTTP method, we need also to accept an HTTP method as a parameter - we called it `httpMethod`, type `string` (see further down why we chose to go with `string`)
- `headers`, type `map[string]string` to apply to the HTTP call
- query parameters (in the case of `GET`), called `queryParameters`, type `url.Values`, 
- a body (in the case of `POST` or `PUT`), called `body`, type `io.Reader`
- Finally, the generic type comes into play for the type we expect to receive - we'll call this `T`
- For the return type we have to handle any errors that may occur, so we'll use the classic go pattern of returning an `error` as the last return value

Altogether, the signature of this powerful function looks like this:

```go
func MakeHTTPRequest[T any](fullUrl string, httpMethod string, headers map[string]string, queryParameters url.Values, body io.Reader, responseType T) (T, error)
```

## Writing the Body of the Function

Let's get into the body of the function. To construct the HTTP client, we'll use Go's built-in `net/http` package:

```go
client := http.Client{}
```

Then we need to parse the URL to be sure that it is even valid:

```go
u, err := url.Parse(fullUrl)
if err != nil {
    return responseType, err
}
```

Now we can handle the GET case, using this URL variable `u` to add the query parameters:

```go
// if it's a GET, we need to append the query parameters.
if httpMethod == "GET" {
    q := u.Query()

    for k, v := range queryParameters {
        // this depends on the type of api, you may need to do it for each of v
        q.Set(k, strings.Join(v, ","))
    }
    // set the query to the encoded parameters
    u.RawQuery = q.Encode()
}
```

We can create the request by passing the `body` parameter in:

```go
// regardless of GET or POST, we can safely add the body
req, err := http.NewRequest(httpMethod, u.String(), body)
if err != nil {
    return responseType, err
}
```

Now we can add the headers:

```go
// for each header passed, add the header value to the request
for k, v := range headers {
    req.Header.Set(k, v)
}
```

Using `net/http`'s `Do` function, we can make the request:

```go
// finally, do the request
res, err := client.Do(req)
```

We then do a variety of checks to validate that the request was successful:

```go
if err != nil {
    return responseType, err
}

if res == nil {
    return responseType, fmt.Errorf("error: calling %s returned empty response", u.String())
}

responseData, err := io.ReadAll(res.Body)
if err != nil {
    return responseType, err
}

defer res.Body.Close()

if res.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
    return responseType, fmt.Errorf("error calling %s:\nstatus: %s\nresponseData: %s", u.String(), res.Status, responseData)
}
```

We've finally gotten to the powerful generic part of this function. We used the `encoding/json` package to unmarshal the response data into the type we expect. We throw an error if the `encoding/json` package is unable to unmarshal to the type specified:


```go
var responseObject T
err = json.Unmarshal(responseData, &responseObject)

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("error unmarshaling response: %+v", err)
    return responseType, err
}
```

If the unmarshaling was successful, we can return the response object and a `nil` error:

```go
return responseObject, nil
```

## Full Code Snippet

That's it! We've constructed a generic function that can handle any type of HTTP call. Here's the full code:


```go
package http_helper

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"net/url"
	"strings"
)

// in the case of GET, the parameter queryParameters is transferred to the URL as query parameters
// in the case of POST, the parameter body, an io.Reader, is used
func MakeHTTPRequest[T any](fullUrl string, httpMethod string, headers map[string]string, queryParameters url.Values, body io.Reader, responseType T) (T, error) {
	client := http.Client{}
	u, err := url.Parse(fullUrl)
	if err != nil {
		return responseType, err
	}

	// if it's a GET, we need to append the query parameters.
	if httpMethod == "GET" {
		q := u.Query()

		for k, v := range queryParameters {
			// this depends on the type of api, you may need to do it for each of v
			q.Set(k, strings.Join(v, ","))
		}
		// set the query to the encoded parameters
		u.RawQuery = q.Encode()
	}

    // regardless of GET or POST, we can safely add the body
	req, err := http.NewRequest(httpMethod, u.String(), body)
	if err != nil {
		return responseType, err
	}

	// for each header passed, add the header value to the request
	for k, v := range headers {
		req.Header.Set(k, v)
	}

    // optional: log the request for easier stack tracing
	log.Printf("%s %s\n", httpMethod, req.URL.String())

	// finally, do the request
	res, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return responseType, err
	}

	if res == nil {
		return responseType, fmt.Errorf("error: calling %s returned empty response", u.String())
	}

	responseData, err := io.ReadAll(res.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return responseType, err
	}

	defer res.Body.Close()

	if res.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		return responseType, fmt.Errorf("error calling %s:\nstatus: %s\nresponseData: %s", u.String(), res.Status, responseData)
	}

	var responseObject T
	err = json.Unmarshal(responseData, &responseObject)

	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("error unmarshaling response: %+v", err)
		return responseType, err
	}

	return responseObject, nil
}
```

## Usage Examples

**GET Request:**

```go
package main

import (
    "net/url"
    "http_helper/http_helper"
)

func main() {
    // the url to call
    url := "https://api.github.com/users/alexellis"

    // the headers to pass
    headers := map[string]string{
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
    }

    // the query parameters to pass
    queryParameters := url.Values{}
    queryParameters.Add("per_page", "1")

    // the type to unmarshal the response into
    var response map[string]interface{}

    // call the function
    response, err := http_helper.MakeHTTPRequest(url, "GET", headers, queryParameters, nil, response)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // do something with the response
    fmt.Printf("response: %+v", response)
}
```

**POST Request:**

```go
package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "net/url"
    "http_helper/http_helper"
)

func main() {
    // the url to call
    url := "https://api.github.com/users/alexellis"

    // the headers to pass
    headers := map[string]string{
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
    }

    // the query parameters to pass
    queryParameters := url.Values{}
    queryParameters.Add("per_page", "1")

    // the body to pass
    body := bytes.NewBufferString(`{"name": "test"}`)

    // the type to unmarshal the response into
    var response map[string]interface{}

    // call the function
    response, err := http_helper.MakeHTTPRequest(url, "POST", headers, queryParameters, body, response)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // do something with the response
    fmt.Printf("response: %+v", response)
}
```

## Bonus: Properly Checking or Typing the `httpMethod` Parameter

As we saw in our original implementation, even in the official go typings for `http.NewRequest`, the HTTP method is simply type `string`. The reason we have decided not to implement any check is that there are only five methods - `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`, and they aren't likely to change at all any time soon! However, it _is_ of course still possible to make typos on the method field when calling this function (i.e. `GET`), so you and your team may decide to make the type a bit more strict. You have two options:

**Option 1. The simple option - a regex**

Match the passed string against a regex with all five HTTP methods. This is the less complex option, but it's not as type-safe. We can use the following regex:

```go
// compile regex to test httpMethod
regex := regexp.MustCompile(`^(GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE)$`)

// check if httpMethod is valid
if !regex.MatchString(httpMethod) {
    return responseType, fmt.Errorf("invalid HTTP method: %s", httpMethod)
}
```

**Option 2. The more involved option - an enum**

We can create an enum and `String` method like so:

```go
type HTTPMethod int

const (
	GET HTTPMethod = iota
	POST
	PUT
	PATCH
	DELETE
)

func (s HTTPMethod) String() string {
	switch s {
	case GET:
		return "GET"
	case POST:
		return "POST"
	case PUT:
		return "PUT"
	case PATCH:
		return "PATCH"
	case DELETE:
		return "DELETE"
	}
	return "unknown"
}
```

Then, change the type of `httpMethod` from `string` to `HTTPMethod`:

```go
func MakeHTTPRequest[T any](fullUrl string, httpMethod HTTPMethod, headers map[string]string, queryParameters url.Values, body io.Reader, responseType T) (T, error) {
```

And we'll have to change the `if` statement to compare against the new `GET` type instead of the string `"GET"`:

```go
if httpMethod == GET {
	// ...code here...
}
```

and we need to cast `httpMethod` to a string when we call `http.NewRequest`:

```go
req, err := http.NewRequest(string(httpMethod), u.String(), body)
```

Option #2 may be a bit over-engineered, but it's also the most type-safe. It's up to you to decide which one you want to use. As mentioned, our team has decided to forgo any checks on the `httpMethod` parameter, as we do extensive [unit and integration testing](http://localhost:8000/blog/one-year-as-chief-technology-officer-at-inclub-insights-from-startup-land/) on our backend that would catch, by way of request errors, any typos in the HTTP method passed to `MakeHTTPRequest`.

## Thanks!

I hope you enjoyed this post! I'm really loving how amazingly easy it is to build backend infrastructure with Go. I'm looking forward to posting more Go content in the future.

Cheers!
