# One Hundred Posts?

Tinkering around with my <Link to="/stats">stats page</Link>, I realized that I was killing it back in 2018! _I had 30 blog posts in 2018!_

A nicely shaped challenge started to form in my head. If I can write more than 40 blog posts this year, not only will I beat my crazy 30-post year in 2018, but...

<div className="text-center">
<Sparkles>it will bring my total blog post count to over 100!</Sparkles>
</div>

_One hundred posts_. A nice round goal if there every was one! I'm also aware that search engines reward sites that frequently publish new content. So that's what I'm gonna do! 👍

# Tracker Component

I've added a tracker to the <Link to="/stats">stats page</Link>, which shows how many days on average I should be publishing a post. It will go up or down, depending on how lazy I am. 😂 

I'll embed it here as a spooky and pressure-y reference:

<div className="stat-tile-container">
<HundredPostChallengeStat/>
</div>

As of writing this post, I'm currently on a 3 day publishing streak, but this will probably be it for a few days. I have some niche full stack topics to write up _very soon_, but don't expect 4 more posts in the next 4 days! 😂 

Cheers! 🍻
