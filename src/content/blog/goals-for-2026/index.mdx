## 2025 in Review

**What a year, what a year, what a year...**

In short, it was an insanely successful and productive year:

- Various pieces of [my art](https://portfolio.chrisfrew.in) hung for a week in the Zürich main train station.
- [The Wheel Screener](https://wheelscreener.com) was featured on AppSumo for over 3 months, and continues to be a partner application there
- I launched FOUR major products / tools:
        1. [LEAPS Screener](https://leapsscreener.com) as a sister project to The Wheel Screener.
        2. [CodeVideo](https://codevideo.io), a SaaS that helps educators generate coding tutorial videos in a declarative, step-by-step manner
        3. [VannaCharm](https://vannacharm.com), a fintech product that tabulates gamma, vanna, and charm exposures both from a historical perspective and with live data if you have a broker connection
        4. [`floe`](https://fullstackcraft.github.io/floe/), an npm package for calculating various options floe metrics from brokers
- And started a handful of others:
        1. [MCP Masterclass](https://mcpmasterclass.com) - hopefully a great series of lessons and courses on MCP usage with all major LLM platforms and in a variety of languages
        2. [FinPodSnap](https://finpodsnap.com) - compiles trade ideas parsed from recent financial podcasts
- I learned all about MCP, Agents, and a variety of other software + AI related topics
- I had my first profitable year as a trader EVER (including a nearly $6K profit month in November and first $2K profit week EVER trading futures - only to lose that 2K the next Monday, overtrading, fear of being wong, along with a myriad of many many other psychological blocks at large are preventing me from keeping my gains - perhaps another post for another time.)
- [Full Stack Craft LLC](https://fullstackcraft.com) broke yearly profit records totaling more than 20K!
- Capped off the year with my own challenge to myself: [12 Days of Full Stack Dev](https://fullstackcraft.com/blog/the-12-days-of-full-stack-dev/), over at Full Stack Craft

## Goals for 2026

If I'm lucky (and trust me, I'm a jaded solopreneur now and I think it will require quite some luck) I hope to move to be working for Full Stack Craft full time by the end of 2026! Here's what I have planned:

- Launch [Options Screener](https://option-screener.com) in Q1 - a project stalled and on hold since the explosion of my other fintech products
- Complete and polish off all currently planned broker integrations (Interactive Brokers, others?) and functionality for [`floe`](https://fullstackcraft.github.io/floe/) by Q1, and perhaps even finding my first corporate licensed customer!
- Launch the initial lesson package over at [MCP Masterclass](https://mcpmasterclass.com) by Q2
- Launch [FinPodSnap](https://finpodsnap.com)!

I'd like more balance in 2026 however, and return to doing more skiing / hiking / biking - I've been working so much that I haven't been doing nearly as much sport as I should.

I'm pretty satisfied to be focusing on just these two goals for 2026.

## Review of 2025 Goals

Let's see how I did. I had:

- ["Computer shutdown protocol" ritual right at 5](https://tim.blog/2022/02/04/cal-newport-transcript/) - The sickest thing here is that I can't remember a day where I was completely done at 5 PM... so needless to say, this will be a hard one for me, as I have trouble stopping :)

❌ lol epic fail.

- One month in either spring, summer, or fall of remote / co-working, WITH my wife and daughter

❌ lol epic fail - but planning this for both August and December 2026!

- Put my art on display for sale somewhere here in Vorarlberg, Austria... If not here then a Christmas market in the US.

✅ Yes! Thank you SWISSARTEXPO!

- Make [CodeVideo](https://codevideo.io) a profitable SaaS

❌ Unfortunately a fail - I do have over 150 total sign-ups, however! Perhaps a task or research project for 2026... There are many many ways CodeVideo could be transformed into a sellable product (or multiple!)

## Thanks!

That's that, looking forward to 2026!
