## Let's Do This! ðŸš€

2021 is my year! Uh oh, I should probably avoid that phrase... we all know what happened in 2020 with too many people saying that! ðŸ˜‚ 

Anyways, I wanted to create an update already in this third week of January on my 2021 goal of doing more course work. I've already released a new course this month, and am well positioned to release at least two more courses this January and February!

## Course Presence

I've split my courses into two platforms so far!

Skillshare:

https://www.skillshare.com/user/christopherfrewin

Udemy:

https://www.udemy.com/user/chris-frewin

If you can recommend another platform for learning and teaching, I'd be happy to consider adding them to my arsenal. Leave a comment below!

## YouTube Presence

I started a YouTube channel for Full Stack Craft here:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLaNEXFBI1wpGtxvGVjfHKw

In this channel, so far I've decided . Perhaps I may move these into. Likely I'll do that with twitch, since I think it is the premier streaming service. Long format videos like Let's Code! series will remain on YouTube.

## Twitch Presence

I started a Twitch channel for Full Stack Craft too:

https://twitch.tv/fullstackcraft

I haven't a live stream yet, but I've got plenty of ideas for it! Expect them in the near future.

## Instagram Presence

I've also finally created an Instagram account for Full Stack Craft (sheesh, took long enough! I know, I know.). Some of the content on this account will match and blend from both my YouTube channel and Twitch live streams, but obviously much shorter and Instagram-friendly posts. Expect some dev memes posted in Instagram as well! ðŸ˜‰

## Art and Design Presence

Kinda on the side, I continue to make prints and ASCII art on the side through two main platforms:

Redbubble:

Design By HÃ¼mans:

https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/fullStackChris

Not all of my art and design work is purely software or developer related; I also create landscape photos, vector graphic posters, and much more!

## Community Presence

Last but not least: my community presence! I'm going to try and share my courses, videos, and streams in all the following communities which I've long been a part of:

Product Hunt Makers:

https://www.producthunt.com/@galt_

DEV Community:

https://dev.to/fullstackchris

Indie Hackers:

## chrisfrew.in? Full Stack Craft? Which One? ðŸ¤”

While it's clear the majority of stuff above is branding and content under Full Stack Craft, I want to be clear that I won't be decreasing my posts here on the blog. (If all goes well, I should actually be posting _more_ here.) Indeed, some posts may be from findings I find during creating courses, videos, and streams. Likewise, some courses may be instead informed by my blog posts here. Both are equally likely.

## Thanks!

As always, thank's for reading. Let's get it this year! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

-Chris
