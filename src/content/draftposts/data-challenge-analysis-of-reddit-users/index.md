# Data analysis

# Evidence of State Actors?

I looked at the. Indeed, seeing as , this would be of interest. I was surprised to find that there was no strong - except for one peculiarity. In 2015, over the last week of May and the first week of June, someone or (something) _registered nearly all the remaining 3 letter usernames left on reddit!_ Even more scary is the number of accounts that have a verified email


```
False    12277
True        26
```

So, of those 12000+ users that were registered in those two weeks, _only 26 of them have a registered email!_

As an interesting side note, this spike of user registration missed a few usernames, 8 to be exact (likely users had trouble finding these remaining):

```
name      created_utc_date
uzi       2016-03-16
tnw       2017-08-07
vox       2017-08-24
wsj       2017-11-14
kfc       2018-02-06
nbc       2018-03-06
npr       2018-03-06
mls       2018-03-27
```

Interestingly, while the majority of these are alliterations for big organzations, only `vox` and `npr` appear to be used. `uzi` has quite a bit of karma, but appears to be a normal user, while all remaining have only their email verified and their initial single link karma.
