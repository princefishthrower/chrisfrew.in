                    Good, because this isn't a get rich quick scheme. These full
                    stack SaaS products take an enormous amount of work to
                    develop and deploy. My book will show you every step along
                    the way, with plenty of real working code snippets and
                    recipes for anything you may need during the development
                    process.

                    you'll be able to build your own completely working full
                    stack SaaS app, from a fancy UI, to a custom API and lambda
                    (AWS) functions, user authentication and authorization, with
                    notifications, logging, emails, and more, at a total cost of
                    $5 / month for the Digital Ocean server droplet.
                </strong>{" "}
                It's then up to you to market your product to make it
                profitable. (Or think of it this way: you'll need only 1 monthly
                $5 / month subscriber to break even on your per-month costs!)
