                Ever since that first Ubuntu experience, I've been in love with
                writing software and{" "}
                <strong>
                    I've learned an extensive variety of frameworks, databases,
                    design patterns, and languages
                </strong>
                , including TypeScript, JavaScript, .NET, Python, React, Redux,
                ABAP, SAPUI5 UI5, C#, PHP7, Postgresql, Magento, and more. I
                love the challenge of building profitable SaaS products!

                <strong>I'm also a full stack software educator.</strong> I
                cherish teaching what I've learned over the years, because I
                think software development is especially difficult these days,
                with all the new tools and frameworks that seem to come out
                daily.

                With all my courses, I focus on both advanced and niche topics and
                in each course I always make considerations into the broader
                backdrop of the entire full stack software ecosystem. If such
                courses sound interesting to you, please check out the{" "}
                <Link to="/courses">Full Stack Courses</Link> page. One final note: I don't want money to be the reason you can't learn from my courses, <b>so if you can't afford a course for whatever reason, simply send me an email and I can get you the course for free.</b>

                I don't want anyone to be intimated by the noise of the software
                world - I too struggle and reach out from time to time for help
                and mentoring. To this end, I try to make my courses as clear as
                possible so you don't get lost or confused. I also avoid the
                theoretical - I offer real world examples far beyond the
                overused 'todo list' app example.
