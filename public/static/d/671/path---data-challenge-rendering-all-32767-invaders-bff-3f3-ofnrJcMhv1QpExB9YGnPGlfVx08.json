I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<h1>Processing and P5.JS</h1>\n<p>I got into the whole Processing universe through a few generative art courses on Skillshare.  If you don’t know yet, Processing is a Java library (I believe there is a Python library too) that makes drawing and creating both fixed and animated digital art very easy. To get started, you need only to download the IDE and fill out a few methods, which could look as simple as:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-java\"><code class=\"language-java\"></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>and already you’ll be getting generative animated art like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./scircles.gif\" alt=\"Gif of randomly colored circles popping up all over the screen\"></p>\n<p>of course, you can build out and develop as complex art as you want, <a href=\"\">like these examples.</a></p>\n<h1>Motivation for this Data Challenge</h1>\n<p>So, after learning the very basics about Processing and working through a few examples on Skillshare, I started exploring other’s work, also mostly on Skillshare. The videogame nerd that I am, I took a particular liking to the ‘Invaders’ work by Jerome Herr’s 2013 work. I then saw he was originally inspired by Jared Tarbell who appears to be the first to do work and provided a fractal implementation of Invader generation.</p>\n<p>That’s when I saw my chance to put my own spin on Invaders. Both Jerome’s and Jared’s works were not determinant. In otherwords, each time you run their respective programs, you get a different result. With my more application and web minded background, I saw that all the Invader data could first be generated, and then loaded at any later time. And so this <strong>Data Challenge!</strong><sup>TM</sup> began! </p>\n<p>I started by diving into the code kindly provided by Jerome, but then I started getting frusterated with the Java syntax entirely. It’s been over 10 years since I wrote any Java, and that was my Junior year in Highschool… so yeah, I was looking for (hopefully) a Javascript possibility. And what do you know, there <em>is</em> a JavaScript library for processing!</p>\n<p>It just so happens that completely by chance, the very cover animation on the home page of my blog, which you may or may not know depending on how often you visit the blog, <em>is</em> a p5.js animation! I didn’t make the connection at first because I originally found that library through <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17716542\">this ‘Show HN’ post showcasing the library back at the end of August, 2018</a>, and that ‘circles bouncing around in a container’ example is a pretty generic example which I just lightly refactored for my site. Plus, the names P5 and Processing just never connected in my mind!</p>\n<p>So I finally bit the bullet and said, alright, I wanna do this in JavaScript, let’s convert this Java code to Javascript. Cuz, cmon, who doesn’t do things in Javascript these days? 😂 (Yes, a bit of sarcasm, but honestly… it’s been fairly true - we’ll see what happens in 2019) Anyway, the REAL reason I wanted to do it in Javascript was to get more practice with p5.js. I’ll likely be using in the future for even more projects!</p>\n<h2>The Scaffolding</h2>\n<p>I <em>also</em> wanted to build this site with react. Then of course, because p5.js uses canvas elements, you need a wrapper to pass events to it from react and blah blah blah. Yay, state-of-the-web in 2019!</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/atorov/react-p5js/tree/master/src/components\">a boilerplate repository</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/atorov\">atorov</a> with not <em>one</em> but <em>two</em> examples of how to use p5.js sketches with react!</p>\n<h2>The Math</h2>\n<p>The math behind Invader generation is lightly discussed directly on the <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/invaders\">Invaders page</a>, but I’ll go into detail here.</p>\n<p>A helpful analogy for me was to picture this array of 15 as 15 switches next to eachother, each being switch on or off at random, until you have every possible combination. In simplist terms, this can be realized as a binary list of length 15.</p>\n<p>I’ll admit, I struggled with how to do this correctly in Python. I jumped immediately to the <code class=\"language-text\">itertools</code> library, trying to work some magic with <code class=\"language-text\">permutations</code> and/or <code class=\"language-text\">combinations</code>, but Python kept thinking it should count each 0 in the list as unique, so I kept getting what I considered ‘repeat’ entries, for example: ‘100000000000000’ and ‘10000000000000’ - they of course appear identical to us, but Python was treating those separate 0’s as in a ‘different’ order) Anyway, after lots of Google and Stackoverflow, it turns out that there is a simple on liner, which actually is the itertools library, just using a not-so-commonly seen method, <code class=\"language-text\">product()</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\">lInvaders <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>join<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>seq<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> seq <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> itertools<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>product<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"10\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> repeat<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># all binary combinations of 0s and 1s and length 15</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>The Data</h2>\n<p>I decided ultimately to use JSON my de facto file format for loading data on the frontend.</p>\n<p>Then, it’s a simple </p>\n<p>as it always seems to be with these fancy data algorithms, 99% of the ‘magic’ to generate the Invaders happens in a double for loop.
