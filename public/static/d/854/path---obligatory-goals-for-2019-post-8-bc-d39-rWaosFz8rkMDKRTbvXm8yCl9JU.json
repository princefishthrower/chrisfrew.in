I suppose you can just make no effort to work towards them, but then they’ll make you feel very guilty as they stare at you from their list 😄. </p>\n<p>So make goals for 2019! 😉</p>\n<p>🙄 Okay, enough with the New Year’s philosophy already…  🙄</p>\n<p>Anyway, this year should be exciting in terms of goals, since I’m not bound to a fixed location of work for 42.5 hours a week. With that said, I’m still keen to be using the traditional 40 hours a week leftover outside of my parttime contract to develop my skills and continue building projects.</p>\n<h2>Goals for 2019</h2>\n<p>I’ve divided my goals into two halves: directly career-oriented goals and miscellaneous (mostly hobbies and )</p>\n<h3>Software Engineering and Career Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn Typescript and incorporate it into my personal stack of choice (As a first challenge, I’m going to convert this very blog to typescript… still keeping GatsbyJS… I predict explosions and failure in my future… 😭)</li>\n<li>Find a paying freelance employer or project (in addition to what looks like a 60-80% time fixed contract for 2019. I should have the time for this)</li>\n<li>Finally build a profitable side hustle! (I’m not sure if it will be a software product, a non-software product, or another shot at an e-commerce store. I suppose since it’s a fresh start this year, I have to be honest with myself about <a href=\"https://sirenapparel.us\">Siren Apparel</a>. The bottom line is that nobody visits the site! I’m going to deactivate our Shopify subscription this month and leave up the website as a boutique made-to-order store.)</li>\n<li>Earn at least $1000 through my Skillshare course(s) (I’ve only got one up so far, but I have many planned in the pipeline. If it’s more obviously I will be very happy!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miscellaneous Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more (I even made a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge\">‘read 30 books’ goal on goodreads.com</a> - I’ll aim for that first, but honestly, it should be even more for all of 2019. This is the year where I will start properly keeping track of my books on goodreads.com as well.)</li>\n<li>Paint more (I made a number of acrylic and watercolor pieces back in 2017, but 2018 was a very slow year in terms of physical pieces art. I published <a href=\"https://instagram.com/chris_creates_art\">much more digital art in 2018</a>.)</li>\n<li>Record and publish at least 2 songs (Acquiring the bare minimum for a home studio was also new for me in 2018, at least in the last half of 2018. I’m learning just how hard recording and sounding with a professional microphone is. It will take practice and some good songwriting, but I am confident to release a few songs this year, more if there is time.)</li>\n<li>Run a marathon (fitness itself was not a problem for me in 2018, I did some massive hikes in the summer, which is a kind of tradition for me, but I just couldn’t find the time - or courage (?) - to go out and do one 😂)</li>\n<li>More winter hiking/ski touring (this is a weird one, but I realized in all of 2018 I used my snowshoes twice for two winter hikes… granted, I went skiing a lot as well last year, but, I mean, I live in Austria, there is really no excuse not to be out and about in the mountains on the weekend, including hiking!)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Obligatory 'Goals for 2019' Post","date":"January 03, 2019","draft":false,"starID":105,"postType":"misc"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/obligatory-goals-for-2019-post/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"26 July, 2018","title":"Led Zeppelin Data Analysis for Lyric Generation and Inspiration","draft":false,"starID":25,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration/","relativeLink":"/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-data-tag/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"28 December, 2018","title":"New Data Tag","draft":false,"starID":105,"postType":"blog","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/new-data-tag/","relativeLink":"/new-data-tag/"}}}}
