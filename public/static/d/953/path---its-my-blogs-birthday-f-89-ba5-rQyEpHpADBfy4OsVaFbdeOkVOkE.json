So to see that ‘Hello World’ post, you’ll need to click either the ‘all’ or ‘blog’ tag, and scroll all the way down.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as a celebration, I built out a stats page for the blog, found at <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/stats\">https://chrisfrew.in/stats</a>. (There will also now be a permanent blog ) This will be a data dump of blog posts per year, both from Gatsby GraphQL queries, and a postgresql database (which keeps track of all those nice ⭐stars⭐ you’ve all been giving me!). For now, this page will just have blog posts per month, stars per post, and similar. We’ll see if I can get more creative ideas with it in the future.</p>\n<p>Thats all for now!</p>\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"It's My Blog's Birthday!","date":"December 12, 2018","draft":false,"starID":102,"postType":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/its-my-blogs-birthday/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/hot-linking-to-lines-in-github/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"19 December, 2017","title":"How to Link to Lines of Code in a Github Repository!","draft":false,"starID":6,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/hot-linking-to-lines-in-github/","relativeLink":"/hot-linking-to-lines-in-github/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"29 December, 2018","title":"Interesting Monopoly Probabilities (To Defeat your Relatives For the Holidays!)","draft":false,"starID":103,"postType":"data","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/","relativeLink":"/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/"}}}}
