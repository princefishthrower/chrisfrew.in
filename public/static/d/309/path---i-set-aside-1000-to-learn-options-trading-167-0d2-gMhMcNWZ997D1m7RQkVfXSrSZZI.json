This is mainly because of some of the projects I’ve been working on; so rest assured there will be plenty of new content coming soon. (I’ve been improving my development arsenal with Redux (haven’t had a need for it yet) and Redux Saga which leverages a lot of great JavaScript such as generator functions for async deliciousness, as well as joining a hackathon team to build a beerpong robot - but more of that in later posts.)</p>\n<h1>Robinhood - Options! AHAHAHAH! Oh wait… my money is gone :sob::sob::sob:</h1>\n<p>Like many millennials will experience in the coming months, my options trading got unlocked on Robinhood. Robinhood is a commission free broker that initial started as a mobile-only (as far as I know Robinhood is only available for United States Citizens - sorry for everyone else - but options are definitely in the cards if you find the right broker!) Anyway, as I experiment with everything, why not also with options? What I’ve seen places for example like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/</a>, options trading can be extremely lucrative, but highly risky. I wanted to learn what they were all about and if it would be indeed possible for me to make some sustainable income - not in a risky YOLO method, but a calculated method that follows mathematical principles.</p>\n<h1>The Posts - on Medium</h1>\n<p>To spare you from more of my rambling, here’s the very first post of the series:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-9a018f11f69e\">https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-9a018f11f69e</a></p>\n<p>and the master post that I will link all further posts to (check out my catastrophic Facebook call failure):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-53b934e55863\">https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-53b934e55863</a></p>\n<p>you can follow my trades on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Galt_\">@Galt_</a>.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy watching me lose all my money! :joy:</p>\n<p>Cheers! :beer:</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I Set Aside $1000 to Learn Options Trading","date":"April 07, 2018","draft":false}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/jump-from-SAPUI5-to-transactions-in-web-gui-with-batch-input/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"25 January, 2018","title":"Jump from SAPUI5 Apps to Transactions in Web GUI with Batch Input","draft":true,"link":"https://chrisfrew.in/jump-from-SAPUI5-to-transactions-in-web-gui-with-batch-input/","relativeLink":"/jump-from-SAPUI5-to-transactions-in-web-gui-with-batch-input/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/laptop-stickers/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"19 December, 2017","title":"My Laptop Stickers Arrived!
