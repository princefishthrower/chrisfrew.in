You can’t access the command line to enter <code class=\"language-text\">\\h</code>! Well, now you can with this amazing SAP shortcut!</p>\n<p>Open any text editor and add the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-txt\"><code class=\"language-txt\">[System]\nName=ERP\nDescription=My company&#39;s super awesome ERP system name\nClient=100\n[User]\nName=CHRIS_IS_AWESOME\nLanguage=EN\n[Function]\nTitle=Debugging\nCommand=/h\nType=SystemCommand\n[Configuration]\nWorkDir=\\\\SomePath\\To_a_working_directory\n[Options]\nReuse=0</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Note that the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> (under <code class=\"language-text\">[System]</code>), <code class=\"language-text\">Client</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> (under <code class=\"language-text\">[User]</code>), and <code class=\"language-text\">WorkDir</code> should all be set to your specific setup. (That’s why I’ve put obvious bogus names for each of them 😄 ).</p>\n<p>I keep a copy of mine on my desktop and in my documents directory, as <code class=\"language-text\">debugging.sap</code>, so it’s always close at hand.</p>\n<p>Whenever you need to debug something running from a popup, just drag and drop this shortcut into the window you want to debug! (either pressing enter in a field or pressing a button to continue the process in the GUI.)</p>\n<p>*** Common gotchya: Things like pressing F4 or clicking the entry help button on any fields will also bring up the debugger after you have dragged and dropped this GUI shortcut - so, make sure you press the button/do the action of exactly what you want to debug!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Debugging ABAP Code with a SAP Shortcut - A Must-Have Tool!","date":"December 27, 2017","draft":false,"starID":9,"postType":"dev"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/debugging-abap-with-a-sap-shortcut/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/data-challenge-rendering-all-32767-invaders/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"12 January, 2019","title":"Data Challenge!
