Since I have my (one) past post, let’s review my progress from 2019 first:</p>\n<h2>2019: Software Engineering and Career Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn Typescript and incorporate it into my personal stack of choice </li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Done. I’ve learned TypeScript. However, I admit I ‘cheat’ by continuing to work in node projects that I started in normal JavaScript, which doesn’t help my case. For example this blog isn’t TypeScript yet. (I need to upgrade the gatsby version anyway, I think I’m like one whole major version behind). I say it with a bit of apprehension, but any future projects that I do with node, I pledge to do what would be the JavaScript parts with TypeScript.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find a paying freelance employer or project </li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Technically acheived through SkillShare. Read on to learn more about my course situation and further goals for courses / tutorials in 2020.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally build a profitable side hustle! </li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Also technically done through SkillShare?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earn at least $1000 through my Skillshare course(s) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>❌ Total fail! I only earned about $100 or so, but that’s my own fault - I only made one course the whole year! Still, $100 itself is certainly nothing to dismiss.</p>\n<h2>2019: Miscellaneous Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ For 2019, ‘Read more’ was also achieved, but my actual numerical goal to read 30 books was a total fail. I only managed 14. For 2020 I’ve made the same goal of 30 books. I’m trying harder this year to achieve it - though it really <em>is</em> quite a lot - nearly 3 books per month! Whew! 😅</p>\n<p>Somehow it took the whole 2019 to get my reading muscles back - but I’m sitting strong here in mid-January already having finished my first book last week and halfway done with two more (that’s right, I’m multitasking with two completely different books!!!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paint more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>❌ This one also was a fail. I made only 2 paintings in 2019, HOWEVER, I really got into digital print making and photography which I continue to work on now. Art is art right? No matter what form?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Record and publish at least 2 songs </li>\n</ul>\n<p>❌ Total fail. Though even here I’m gonna take out only a share of the blame. My buddy, with whom I was <em>supposed</em> to finish a pop-punk EP with <em>years</em> ago, has decided he wants to get his M.S. degree… <em>while</em> working a full time job. I mean, achievement, degrees, psh what the heck are those? Lets finish that EP!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run a marathon </li>\n</ul>\n<p>❌ Fail. (Though I did do a 50km / 7000 Hm hike this year, so I’ll write it off as 1/2 fail - I also did two half marathons)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More winter hiking/ski touring (this may seem like a random one, but I realized in all of 2018 I used my snowshoes twice for two winter hikes… granted, I went skiing a lot as well last year, but, I mean, I live in Austria, there is really no excuse not to be out and about in the mountains on the weekend, including hiking!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Definitely got this one in 2019, and hopefully there will be even more winter trips in 2020, since I’ve planned some more ski tours and even some mountain hut overnighters!</p>\n<h2>2019 Review</h2>\n<p>Software engineering and Career Goals: 4/5<br/>\nMiscellaneous Goals: 2/5<br/>\nTotal: 6/10</p>\n<h1>Goals for 2020</h1>\n<p>Not including what I mentioned above (many are extensions from 2019) there are some new goals I think are manageable for 2020. </p>\n<p>As I did for 2019, I will separate my goals for 2020 first listing my ‘Software Engineering and Career Goals’ and then my ‘Miscellaneous Goals’.</p>\n<h2>2020: Software Engineering and Career Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work ‘for the man’ less - maybe even ‘work’ less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I mean by this one is not working all the time for projects I get payed for directly on a contract or hourly basis. In 2019, due to a monster project, I experienced far too many 10-12 hour days which left me with no brain capacity left to work on producing other things I care about - such as opensource projects, my education and tutorial software courses, and just plain hacking for fun. </p>\n<p>I’m in a point in my career where I know enough to share my skills and work on more diverse projects. I just have to finally say enough is enough and take charge of what I want to produce out of my career. I understand there is a high demand for software developers who can get the job done, but there comes a point where I have to fix the balance of projects I work on. I have to take some time for myself and produce what I think is valuable. 2020 is that year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make more software engineering tutorial videos and blog posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Really just an extension of the above goal, but I want to name it explicitly for 2020, because I neglected both in 2019. As a corollary to this goal, I want to expand my courses outside of SkillShare. Too often I see a head scratcher solution on stack overflow, checked as the ‘correct’ solution, just because yes, it <em>answers</em> the problem itself and works, but its not a true <em>solution</em>. Or, even worse, its a question that is simply left ignored. What I hope to bring to my courses is much more than just a coding play-by-play, but <em>explaining</em> the steps I am taking and the reasoning behind what I am doing. I think those are the true insights and helpful points that courses provide; much more so than anything that could be rote-memorized from what I code.</p>\n<h2>2020: Miscellaneous Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve cooking skills </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This one shouldn’t be too hard - I have some basic skills in the kitchen and have a decent number of go to recepies based on what is in our pantry / fridge. For 2020, I’m talking about expanding into things like self-created sauces, more dynamic recipes such as using different oven functions and pan techniques, and using more diverse ingredients in whatever I create. </p>\n<p>As a very early 2020 update, I can say that already I’ve made some amazing oven-baked chicken and a feta-arugala-almond toasted sandwhich! (A quick and random hint - find recipes that use the broiling function on your oven - it opens a whole new world of recipes that you thought only the pros could do!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homebrew an <em>amazing</em> beer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My girlfriend and I have brewed 5 batches of beer since 2016. They were all <em>decent</em> beers, and actually the latest one was closer to the <em>great</em> side, but in my opinion none have been totally <em>amazing</em>. In 2020, I want to homebrew a beer where I (and others) can say, “Wow! <em>You</em> actually brewed that?!” In other words, I want our own tasty homebrew beer to be indistinguishable from that of a well respected brewery.</p>\n<p>Well that’s it. 2019 was a <em>really</em> hard year with that project I mentioned - it was easily the hardest project I’ve ever did (even more so than my <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010218016302279\">master’s thesis</a>) in terms of length and arduous labor. But out of it came a huge learning experience that was all about the Magento 2 framework, and of course I have the added benefit of being able to add that project to my portfolio. It’s certainly a project I won’t forget.</p>\n<p>-Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<p>Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goals For 2020","date":"January 12, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/goals-for-2020/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-single-bash-command-to-simultaneously-run-and-compile-a-csharp-file/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Single Bash Command To Simultaneously Run and Compile a CSharp (.cs) File"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/full-abap-push-and-message-channel-tutorial-with-working-code-examples/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Full ABAP Push and Message Channel Tutorial With Working Code Examples"}}}}}
