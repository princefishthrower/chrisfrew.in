Lots of people on podcasts say it I say screw that. That is a lot like saying, “oh hey, did you know it’s impossible to write great apps or games if you’re a solo developer?” or, “What?!?! A nice dynamic UI, <em>with</em> a relational database backend <em>and</em> a websocket to send messages between the two!?!? You’re a madman!!!“.</p>\\n<p>Wait a second - isn’t that what this whole Web 3.0 stuff is supposed to do? Empower developers to make great apps all by themselves? I mean jeez, I know us, we’ve spent hours on hours learning python, backend databases, container deploys, dabbled in numerous backend frameworks, not even getting started with your favorite modern front end framework of choice (yeah, there’s a lot of those too!) like Vue, React, Ember or more.</p>\\n<p>Of course full stack developers know they are more a less a jack of all trades, master of none. I know there are people who could kick my ass at both Postgresql database maintenance, and there are just as many frontend people who could totally kick my ass with a badass UI in React.</p>\\n<p>For me, full stack has always been about the adventure of software itself - its the nature of the discipline in fact - there are new tools being rolled out literally every day. I mean, really, if you’ve written backend code for databases but have also built websites (I know there are many of us out there!)- how are you supposed to write that succinctly on a resume or CV? “Hi, I’m Chris, part-time-database-program-writer-and-part-time-front-end-engineer”? I do concede that the moniker ‘full stack’ is not really a good enough description by itself. In my case, I could say ‘full stack <em>web developer</em>’. With more practice, maybe someday a full stack <em>android developer</em> - but I need to run through a lot more projects before that happens :)</p>\\n<h1>:wine: A Toast to Full Stack Developers :wine:</h1>\\n<p>Just because we’re not the greatest, most amazing expert in a certain language, just because we don’t know certain frameworks, just because we haven’t focused in one software engineering discipline our entire careers…</p>\\n<p><em>Shouldn’t we still be able to call ourselves full stack developers?</em></p>\\n<p><strong>Of course.</strong></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"A Toast to Full Stack Developers\",\"date\":\"December 12, 2017\",\"draft\":false}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/a-toast-to-full-stack-developers/\",\"prev\":null,\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"24 December, 2017\",\"title\":\"An NPM Christmas Easter Egg\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/a-toast-to-full-stack-developers.json\n// module id = 550\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>No, It’s not Easter for Christmas…</h2>\\n<h3>It’s a quick surprise for those celebrating christmas from npm!</h3>\\n<p>Simply issue <code>npm xmas</code> in your terminal:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-650df.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 104.14364640883977%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"A nice little Christmas tree\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-fb8a0.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-1a291.png 148w,\\n/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-2bc4a.png 295w,\\n/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-fb8a0.png 590w,\\n/static/npm-christmas-2a17567402dd88093188006fb75ee2b6-650df.png 724w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>(You would learned this only if you been a good boy or girl and read NPM’s recent Newsletter 😄😉)</p>\\n<p>Another fun fact - the tree is not deterministic!

I wrote in my SAPUI5 some warehouse task code that would have a real time. How did I do it?</p>\\n<p>I wrote a <code>window.setInterval()</code> function that would ping table <code>/SCWM/WT</code> 😊 and check for any new lines - with an OData <code>GET_ENTITY_SET</code> server request. 😊 😊</p>\\n<p>Yeah.</p>\\n<p>Well, I was lucky to learn about websockets from one of our EWM. Then I was even luckier to learn a bit more about the technical aspects (when to subscribe, unsubscribe, destroy, and create websockets instances from actions on the front end).</p>\\n<p>So here’s how to add websockets to your SAPUI5 app<sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-1\\\">1</a></sup>.</p>\\n<h2>Transactions</h2>\\n<p>All backend push and messaging channels can be managed with just two transactions:  <code>SAMC</code>, for message channels and <code>SAPC</code>, for push channels. Easy enough.</p>\\n<h2>Creating a Message Channel</h2>\\n<p>As we will see, to create a proper push channel, we will first need a message channel, so that is where we start off. An ABAP message channel is a way of subscribing current programs to any - the best thing about push channels is that if the push channel <em>isn’t</em> listening, there is no error and nothing else negative happens anywhere else in the system - that is, granted you <code>TRY</code> and <code>CATCH</code> your push channel messaging properly.</p>\\n<p>So let’s get started in transaction <code>SAMC</code>:</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>We define the message channel name, and, most importantly, define what programs can use this message channel and what type of message this channel will handle (there are only 2 - numeric and string)</p>\\n<p>Now, as I mention before, we use these channels to hook into any ABAP program, so that any time they are executed by anyone (or anything) in the system, the channel will be messages. A safe way to hook into an existing program (using our newly created <code>Z_AWESOME_CHANNEL</code>) looks as follows:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-abap\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">REPORT</span> my_super_cool_existing_report\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>Creating a Push Channel</h2>\\n<p>Ok, now we head to transaction <code>SAPC</code> - we are no going to define a websocket that will be hooked up to our push channel. That way, when something happens in our program, it will message to all subscribed channels, which will be forwarded , and then ultimately, to the most important part, the frontend for our user to see!</p>\\n<h2>Frontend</h2>\\n<p>On the frontend I create a general websocket function that creates a websocket instance. In order to have the correct service for each view, upon each view change I call this function, which always creates a new instance if there exists a websocket instance already. This way we are sure that on any view change, we have a fresh running instance of the websocket doing the correct task for this view.</p>\\n<p>That function looks like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code></code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Note that you of course have to us <code>ws://</code> as the protocol in the link name!</p>\\n<p>On the backend, that ends up looking like a <code>CASE</code> statement:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-abap\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">CASE</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2>Code</h2>\\n<p>Yep, you’re going to have to write some ABAP code too. Luckily for us, when we create a push channel in transaction SAPC, SAP generates a class skeleton with 4 methods:</p>\\n<p><code></code>\\n<code></code>\\n<code></code></p>\\n<hr/>\\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-1\\\">\\n1. Note that unfortunately the SAP Web IDE does not yet support websockets, that is, without network wizardry. I haven't managed to get it to work. I've left  long ago a message with the person who was the lead on Cloud Connector asking if websocket (`ws` protocol) would eventually something to be supported, but haven't heard anything.\\n</div>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"ABAP Push and Message Channels\",\"date\":\"January 12, 2018\",\"draft\":true}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/abap-push-and-message-channels/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"24 December, 2017\",\"title\":\"An NPM Christmas Easter Egg\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/an-npm-christmas-easter-egg/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/building-raiblocks-charts/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"30 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"Interacting with a Blockchain - Building a Webapp for RaiBlocks\",\"draft\":true,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/building-raiblocks-charts/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/building-raiblocks-charts/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/abap-push-and-message-channels.json\n// module id = 552\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/building-raiblocks-charts/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>Full stack</h2>\\n<p>This post is going to go through how I built <a href=\\\"raiblocks-charts.herokuapp.com\\\">raiblocks-charts.herokuapp.com</a></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Interacting with a Blockchain - Building a Webapp for RaiBlocks\",\"date\":\"January 30, 2018\",\"draft\":true}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/building-raiblocks-charts/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/abap-push-and-message-channels/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"12 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"ABAP Push and Message Channels\",\"draft\":true,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/abap-push-and-message-channels/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/abap-push-and-message-channels/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"11 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"Colors For SAP Web IDE!\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/building-raiblocks-charts.json\n// module id = 553\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/colors-for-sap-web-ide/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h1>Dude, where’s my color scheme?!</h1>\\n<p>At some point, <em>SAP took away my Monokai Color scheme from the SAPUI5 Web IDE!</em> That is unforgivable…</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/unforgivable-595b9ad46814fa0343339c67fe02f92a.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Like I said, unforgivable.\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Don’t worry - code to the rescue!</h2>\\n<p>I wrote a small tampermonkey script that address this issue, and you can get your monokai colors back!

You can see this in the code comments with date 2018.04.19.</em></p>\\n<h1>First off, Congratulations! 🎊</h1>\\n<p><sup>And a happy new year!

However, as part of my indentured servitude that is being a full-time employee, I spent a day tinkering, writing, and testing code with these function modules. No matter what combinations of inputs I provided, I couldn’t get the <em>activity confirmation amount</em> to be calculated, which are a very important part of the final calculation of the confirmation! (more on the actual final confirmation submission is also included in later on) From scrounging around on SCN and the SAP blog, I learned that many developers had the same issue with these functions. (Things like date, yield/scrap amounts, and the goods movements would be proposed just fine by these BAPIs.)</p>\\n<p>So, <strong>calculating these activity confirmation amounts programmatically (in ABAP) will be the main focus of this post <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-1\\\">2</a></sup>.</strong></p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, with much more digging, the reason the two functions wouldn’t produce activity confirmation amounts never became quite clear to me. I realized I would have to calculate them in a more manual manner and then add them to those BAPI structures <code>lt_timetickets</code> manually.</p>\\n<h2>The Calculation Function Module</h2>\\n<p>Through SAP GUI in transaction <code>CO11N</code>, determining system-proposed confirmation amounts is easy enough by and asking the system to do the calculation for us <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-3\\\">3</a></sup>. My struggle was finding the programmatic way to do this in ABAP.</p>\\n<p>Anyone with significant production planning experience (i.e., not me 😂 ) knows that the actual formula behind the activity calculation is not with the activity itself, but with the work center <em>behind</em> the activity <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-4\\\">3</a></sup>.</p>\\n<p>In transaction <code>CR03</code> (display work center), in the ‘Costing’ Tab, there is a ‘Formula’ button with the check symbol on it:</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>This was my starting point to find any sort of function that could do this programmatically - with more time, I learned from SCN of a function that does exactly that! It’s called <code>CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC</code>!</p>\\n<p>Let’s head on over to transaction <code>SE37</code> and test it ourselves!</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>😑😑😑 shit… SAP, you had one job to do!</p>\\n<p>Fine. We’ll do it ourselves. We can open up the source code of <code>CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC</code> and set a breakpoint in the first line:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-f1f65.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 61.25954198473282%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"The first possible line in the function we can breakpoint\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-fb8a0.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-1a291.png 148w,\\n/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-2bc4a.png 295w,\\n/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-fb8a0.png 590w,\\n/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-526de.png 885w,\\n/static/function-breakpoint-7f2c794c579923ae724605626ba5369b-f1f65.png 1048w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>and in CR03, drag our <a href=\\\"https://chrisfrew.in/debugging-abap-with-sap-shortcut\\\">debugging shortcut into the calculation window</a>, and we press return SAP debugging’s return button to jump out to whatever parent program is calling this function… \\n  <a class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\" href=\\\"/static/return-00b1c8c77e113cd8f5a0809a202489c2-0c9b0.png\\\" style=\\\"display: block\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"noopener\\\">\\n  \\n  <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\" style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 58px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\">\\n    <span class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\" style=\\\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAUCAYAAACNiR0NAAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACj0lEQVQ4y9WUy06TQRiGWbv0BrgFlm5MjFfghoWEhSIJJkQSVKBKOFSCIEJCKiooBBALCATahBKIcsZISilt/xYolFIOErSlfwsUaAUep8UGJYVg1IWLNzOTmTzzfoeZOJ9xmr+puH8OlCdtR6NBOp6LUf4d4DHEinfCgldvYsvmYnPKjjwhHR0+JzTu2JkVv2We7bk1Qut7WB4rWBwdISDWYbe+qRlOiyaGwyPY+vt+bCW5zFeV03clHs2liziHBsTBWeRxM7Je+iGLcG6NCY0AvXozO043loJMepMvY2yuoftqPF0JF1ixTHKwEyLkkfkmbwr52d/cZndlXaRHiu3QK24MA6XCuxjV1ewfgCE/A7d+nLeNLSQmJ3ErLY0bKTdJSU0lMek6qtIy9mdcbJyA/uJQKryH/nkxm9ICPoONXfMcExodrVU19HVqGB4ZYWhgkA8D/ZjGPrEt8npmyJIIeaq1lsAW+FxfkB1rbJtmYclNb3Mbt9PTeaBQkJ5xh/qqF4RsTjYM1tjAwMJXpKJseq4l8LE4k8GsZIyVSnwWB37hwjQ0RqdWQ0+3ji6tlvH+QQLiMm8shxHbYtM9Oo6rsQ5X/WsWa1+y2t6GR1QzIMLXNbVwX5FDkVJJtnDZ/KqOoHUhtsMo1G+yszW7wpZ9VfTjZ/wil0HnKgQPmZ4w0vCmkY62dprUaoZ1veyY7Wc4jD6x8JMTt3pE5YPSPFp1K9kFeZRVVFD5TEWlSkVpRTnalnfsSQ68pzk8qXAoQdsCPQ1qHuU85Gm+kpLcfJ7kFVKQpaCjui6yv3FeYKRY4vCe1QFzKxzal4SWIyNzyxGYd9J6/u8rmoYw1COad+MnhdfRUGP24f/1wf6pvgPpiV2HYVoizQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\">\\n      <img class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\" style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\" alt=\\\"return\\\" title=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/static/return-00b1c8c77e113cd8f5a0809a202489c2-0c9b0.png\\\" srcset=\\\"/static/return-00b1c8c77e113cd8f5a0809a202489c2-0c9b0.png 58w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 58px) 100vw, 58px\\\">\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n     and…</p>\\n<p>🙏 Violá!

Well, first, they are doing a do loop six times. Aha, we know why - because there can be a total of six confirmation values <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-3\\\">3</a></sup>  - SAP is by default looping over all of them.</p>\\n<p>Now for the function parameters themselves: they pass the work center code (<code>arbid</code>), the operation number (<code>rcrop</code>), the index of the confirmation (a value of 1-6), our 4 default values (<code>vgw</code>), and the date (<code>date</code>).</p>\\n<p>In turn, the function spits out the fixed value amount of the activity calculation (<code>value_fix</code>), the variable part (<code>value_var</code>), both in whatever unit the function gives out in <code>unit</code>, and <code>co_a</code> is for the cost center accounting <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-4\\\">4</a></sup>. There are actually four exceptions to this function, so I’m not sure why SAP internal is taking only two of them.

Did it feel like a marathon? :runner: Because it felt to <em>me</em> like a marathon all that time I was scratching my head. I hope you all enjoyed and found this post useful for a not-so-often programmed function of this production planning section of SAP.</p>\\n<p>Another note and quick plug 😄 I hope everyone can appreciate the time I put into creating these posts (<em>hint:</em> posts this long take a <strong>LONG</strong> time to write!). It would make me happy and give me the motivation to keep writing these detailed ABAP posts if you’d consider donating (in the footer of any page on this blog) I have a <a href=\\\"https://www.paypal.me/chrisfrewin\\\">PayPal.me link</a>, and I’m also an Ethereum developer if you’d like to donate Ether or if you would like to donate some RaiBlocks, as I am a RaiBlocks enthusiast if you would prefer to donate in that way.</p>\\n<p>💩 Ok, plug done! 💩</p>\\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>\\n<hr/>\\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-1\\\">\\n1. Activities/phases are for production orders; Operations are for process orders. From this point onward, I will refer just to activities, since this post focuses on production orders and then I finally post the adjacent code for process orders.\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-2\\\">\\n2. I have to give credit where credit is due! I received a lot of assistance from our production planning module supervisor - he showed me the transactions that finally got me to a working result. 👍\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-3\\\">\\n3. Note: At my company, we usually use only up to four confirmation activities. Note that there can be up to six, but for this example, we'll say that the confirmation process has only a maximum of four.\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-4\\\">\\n4. You can set up your production planning (PP) module to give you a proposal amount for the activities, directly when you are doing confirmations transaction `CO11N`:\\n<p>Upon pressing ‘enter’ for with a new amount:\\n</p>\\n<p>Pressing ‘OK’ for this window, we get a popup:</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>We see that the Labor time is provided here. It’s likely 30 min for a full 100 KG, since the system is proposing only 15 minutes for 50 KG, half of what the full order amount should be. (I know, it’s not a full four field example - but values would also be proposed if you had more fields like machine time, machine set-up, etc.)</p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"footnote-4\\\">\\n4. I ended up determining that you can exclude parameter `co_a` without any issues - however, this may be how the settings at my own company work - you can look deeper into the SAP example to include it.\\n</div>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Calculating Activity Amounts for Production and Process Orders with SAP ABAP\",\"date\":\"January 03, 2018\",\"draft\":false}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/calculating-activity-amounts-for-process-and-production-orders-with-sap-abap/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"11 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"Colors For SAP Web IDE!\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/colors-for-sap-web-ide/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"08 April, 2018\",\"title\":\"How to Create Posts That Reach the Top of the Front Page on Subreddits (And How I Created Two of Them for /r/wallstreetbets)\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/calculating-activity-amounts-for-process-and-production-orders-with-sap-abap.json\n// module id = 555\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h1>The Posts</h1>\\n<p>So, here are the two meme posts, in all their glory, the first of which is a Robinhood (albeit grim) Parody:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/robinhood_parody-8828d8b0302e0f37976816b6ae0b941f-2777b.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative;

But I’d like to think the larger part of the popularity is the artwork.</p>\\n<h1>1. Ideas, Ideas, Ideas!</h1>\\n<p>If you want a post that does really well (like make front page well), it has to be very creative. Anything even slightly subpar in the creativity region, even if it is your own original content, will fail (trust me, I’ve had my share of failed attempts). The problem with this is because the subreddit has seen dozens of others of very similar posts of whatever you think is a “little bit” creative. Many members of the subreddit have posted “semi-creative” content before you, trust me. My tips for doing this are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>leverage your own skills - are you an expert in skills related to the subreddit, an artist, a programmer, are you a great organizer of content or ideas - do you have any skill that could be used in a helpful way by members of the subreddit?</li>\\n<li>spend a while on the subreddit, take notes of what posts do well (of the type of post you think you can make - info post) my two best have been on /r/wallstreetbets because I’ve been getting into investing and the market a lot recently, and setting aside the jokes and memes (of which I am a prime contributor), I think there is a lot of correct information on the subreddit</li>\\n<li>get creative - can you combine some ideas that members of the subreddit won’t expect or will be funny, no matter what you do, I think the key point is to bring something new. Perhaps slightly with this idea is that a bonus point is if it is something - something completely new is almost always good, but a topic that has just happened recently or is relevant to current subreddit and hasn’t been discussed is a golden opportunity</li>\\n<li>a good test is to check if your rushing about an idea - if you <em>are</em>, I would guess it is likely an idea many other people are or have posted about. I realized I wasn’t rushing with creating my posts, because I knew they were so creative that nobody would come close to posting anything like it.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>2. Pick your Skill and Leverage It!</h1>\\n<p>I selected my art and graphic design skills as my meme / post advantages. (You can examples of my previous digital (and hand made) artwork at (<a href=\\\"https://chrisfrewin.design\\\">https://chrisfrewin.design</a>)[https://chrisfrewin.design])</p>\\n<p>The fun part for me was that these ‘memes’ were just pieces of art I wanted to create anyway - the advantage is that they could of course be sweet, sweet karma generators.</p>\\n<h1>3. Publish it! (and Post Title selection)</h1>\\n<p>Once you’re satisfied with your content your going to post (whatever it be video, blog post, image, text, whatever), its time to post! I’ve found that despite what reddit recommends, as long as your title is somewhat creative, your super awesome creative post will do just fine. Also a note with post timing / and time of day of the post, I’ve found it doesn’t really matter - I just post whenever my post is ready, I don’t do any special timings. That first one for example was posted late on a Friday evening, and the S&#x26;P Map on a  If it is truly a front page post, it will gain traction regardless - I suppose the posting time of day could control exactly <em>how</em> fast.</p>\\n<p>As a final check you can review your own confidence at posting time - if you find yourself not worried at all, it’s going to do fine. If it’s a winner, you’ll know soon enough as you are bombarded with the replies to your post. I left my S&#x26;P meme for 4 hours and when I can back to check on reddit I was welcomed with over 1300 upvotes and 60+ post replies.</p>\\n<p>If there is interest, I can go through my process of the technical graphic design portion of how I built these posts (I use Gimp and Inkscape - yes I’m a cheapass nerd who uses open source graphic design software 🤓)</p>\\n<p>Hope you enjoyed and picked up a tip or two and got a laugh out of the memes!</p>\\n<p>-Cheers! 🍺</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"How to Create Posts That Reach the Top of the Front Page on Subreddits (And How I Created Two of Them for /r/wallstreetbets)\",\"date\":\"April 08, 2018\",\"draft\":false}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/calculating-activity-amounts-for-process-and-production-orders-with-sap-abap/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"03 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"Calculating Activity Amounts for Production and Process Orders with SAP ABAP\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/calculating-activity-amounts-for-process-and-production-orders-with-sap-abap/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/calculating-activity-amounts-for-process-and-production-orders-with-sap-abap/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/dropdowns-in-readmes/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"22 December, 2017\",\"title\":\"Dropdowns in Markdown README's!\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/dropdowns-in-readmes/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/dropdowns-in-readmes/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/creating-front-page-posts-on-subbreddit-and-how-i-created-two-of-them-for-wallstreetbets.json\n// module id = 556\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/dropdowns-in-readmes/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h2>HTML in Markdown!?</h2>\\n<p>Well, it’s a little known fact (at least it was for me) that you can use native HTML tags are supported in Markdown, though the support over different sites is varying.

Bitcoin recently. Tulip Madness. Silk Road. Ponzi Scheme. While this blog will (rest assured) remain about software development and programming, I had to give my final say (barring whatever crap I may spew on reddit from time to time 😄) SOMEWHERE about Bitcoin. I decided that somewhere was here.</p>\\n<h1>My Promise to You</h1>\\n<p>Let me promise you, I won’t post about Bitcoin speculation on this blog ever again. (At least in relation to any sort of price speculation, maybe one day later I will post on some tech stuff)</p>\\n<h1>The Numbers</h1>\\n<p>The most basic key economics of Bitcoin for determining it’s price are: 1. there will only be 21 million of them, and 2. The demand for the holy coin is ever increasing, and at least all of 2018, it looks as though that trend will hold. As long as these two key economic ingredients hold true (the 21 million I am 100% sure of, it’s <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c24337964f2d0500975abb4ef55c324daaf349b6/src/main.cpp#L1361\\\">baked intp Bitcoin’s code</a>), the inarguable bottom line is that the price will go up, no exceptions. We don’t even need any technical analysis! There are millions of examples throughout history: something with a limited supply and increasing demand, the “things” price goes up. No exceptions.</p>\\n<h1>First to Market</h1>\\n<p>It’s important to remember, Bitcoin was the first of its kind (certainly not the best - many improvements in other coins and blockchain protocols exist - more on that below), Bitcoin has both the largest <em>and</em> majority of the market caps among all the other cryptocurrencies. (Edit: December 19th! Bitcoin dipped just below 49.9% market capitilization in crypto! <a href=\\\"frewinchristopher.github.io/markcap\\\">I built a small bookmarklet called MarkCap</a> for <a href=\\\"coinmarketcap.com\\\">coinmarketcap.com</a> that puts the percent market cap next to the market cap number.)</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>A comic I thought up about Bitcoin  😂😂😂 (<em>comic is still not done, but it will show up here soon</em>).</p>\\n<p>As cash flows from standard gold to Bitcoin, the market cap could approach the <em>trillions</em> range. With that order of magnitude of market cap, 1 Bitcoin would have:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Market Capitalization</th>\\n<th>Bitcoin price*</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>1 Trillion</td>\\n<td>~$55,500</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>2 Trillion</td>\\n<td>~$111,000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>3 Trillion</td>\\n<td>~$167,000</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>…</td>\\n<td>…</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>7 Trillion (market cap of gold)</td>\\n<td>~$389,000</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>*(assuming around 18 million Bitcoins - currently 16.7 as of writing this entry - it’s accurate enough as of this posting in late 2017; the 18th millionth Bitcoin isn’t expected to be mined until October 9th, 2019 - check out <a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/the-bitcoin-mining-schedule-from-december-18-2017-to-june-8-2020-407db59e69f4\\\">my post on medium about the mining schedule until the next halving</a>)</p>\\n<p>I predict:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>$20,000 by January 1st 2018 (update: we already made it for a short period of time on December 17th!)</li>\\n<li>$50,000 by end of Q2 2018 (i.e. end of June 2018)</li>\\n<li>$100,000 by end of Q4 2018 (i.e. end of December 2018)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>But… 5 Years Out? 10 Years?</h1>\\n<p>So I have a somewhat non-average view of Bitcoin in the long run (5-10 year) time range (yes, things like <a href=\\\"http://blog.flippening.watch/what-is-the-flippening/\\\">THE FLIPPENING</a> I think could happen). The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3. And what happens to the miners once mining stop? <a href=\\\"https://news.bitcoin.com/what-happens-bitcoin-miners-all-coins-mined/\\\">That’s still a question where I’m not totally satisfied what some of the answers are.</a></li>\\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\\\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\\\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don’t see much innovation there</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Once these aspects of the market are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin’s ‘store of wealth’ could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it’s purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\\n<p><strong>As of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this stagnation, there will be a slow starting decrease downtrend in Bitcoin’s price, then accelerating, bringing the price of Bitcoin back to its pre-boom levels (think: $5 - $10 range). When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5-10 years. But it’s my long term feeling.</p>\\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\",\"date\":\"December 18, 2017\",\"draft\":false}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/final-say-bitcoin/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/detailed-look-at-bdc-in-abap/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"24 January, 2018\",\"title\":\"A Detailed Look at ABAP's BDC Method\",\"draft\":true,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/detailed-look-at-bdc-in-abap/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/detailed-look-at-bdc-in-abap/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"10 May, 2018\",\"title\":\"Fully Automating Chrisfrew.in Productions - Part 1 of ??? - Roadmap and Links to Entire Process\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/final-say-bitcoin.json\n// module id = 560\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<h1>Links to All Parts of the Process</h1>\\n<p>Before I get into the description, you may be here just to get the links.

Basically the process is simply:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>‘cron’ job that every 30 seconds to ping all my websites</li>\\n<li>Check for 200 response from each, if not send email</li>\\n<li>If an even greater problem is found, i.e., the site doesn’t even return a 4** code, also send an email</li>\\n<li>A ‘reactive’ monitor - that is, don’t just send a mail when there are problems, try to spool up the server again and log if there is a failure!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>To accomplish this I utilized just three Node.js libraries:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>http</code>, to request the various sites I control</li>\\n<li><code>node-schedule</code>, to create a cron-like check</li>\\n<li><code>nodemailer</code>, a fantastic easy-to-use bare bones emailer, we’ll send an email when there is a non 2** HTTP response or simple a non-response error (see code below) (<a href=\\\"https://medium.com/@manojsinghnegi/sending-an-email-using-nodemailer-gmail-7cfa0712a799\\\">there is a great medium post on an about 20ish liner in Node.js to get started</a>, and the setting in gmail you have to change)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Obviously this can be developed into a much more complex monitor, but for now I am happy as to how it runs.</p>\\n<h1>Improvements</h1>\\n<p>A few things I would like to improve with this Server:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Control the <code>const</code> array from somwehere else, perhaps a management GUI where I can maintain sites</li>\\n<li>A global log class that could also be used in my Chrisfrew.in Productions Twitter Bot (coming soon in another post)</li>\\n<li>Increasing the information and complexity of what is sent in the emails?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h1>Code</h1>\\n<p>As always, the most <a

I want to share first how I did it, and then how I should have done it in hopes to save others time if they should wish to attempt tackling this debauchery of paperwork and bureaucracy.*</p>\\n<p><sup>* Trust me when I say I’m not a legal counsel so always take my words with a grain of salt. However, as of February 2016, these were the steps I took to get started working. UPDATE 2017: The process is still the same as described here. I know this because you have to renew your permits each year for your first three years in Austria. Granted, it is much easier the second and third times as you have all of your papers in place already from the previous year!</sup></p>\\n<h2>Overview</h2>\\n<p>When you plan on living in Austria for longer than three months, and then longer than sixth months (there are some other special visas such as a student visa, artist visa which last for sixth months), then the government requires you to apply for a Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, a specific type of Aufenhaltstitel, or residence permit, very similar to a green card in the US. Then, Liechtenstein requires that you have Aufenhaltstitel, or a working permit to legally work in Liechtenstein. Your company should help you with this process, and, since a cross border working permit for Liechtenstein is very common, the application is relatively simple compared to the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung.</p>\\n<h2>Legal Entities</h2>\\n<p>There are four legal entities you are going to need to work with to get everything to jive:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Perhaps most important, is the Bezirkshauptmannschaft, or “BH” for short in German, or in English, the district authority. This is where you will complete your Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, or residence permit.</li>\\n<li>Another place you will visit is the Gemeindeamt, or town hall of the town your apartment is in. This is where you will make your Meldezettel, or certification of registration. When you do this registration, you want to make your Haupwohnsitz, or main place of residence to that town.</li>\\n<li>You will also need to work with the Besitzer, or the owner of the apartment. If the apartment you want to rent is a private, this shouldn’t be so difficult. Unfortunately, it is quite common in Austria that apartments are owned by an apartment company, so you may have to work with one of those companies to finally get the rent contract and the signature of the official owner of the building itself.</li>\\n<li>Finally, the two documents you will need to send from Liechtenstein are mandated by the Besitzer Ausländer- und Passamt, or the Immigration and Passport Office of Liechtenstein.\\nLong Term Residence Permit(Nieder- lassungs- bewilligung)\\nFor the residence permit, fill out the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application. If you already have your apartment, you should even be able to fill in those parts as well. If you don’t have a spouse or children, you can skip many parts of this application. Anyways, the BH will look over it when you first supply it to them anyway, so don’t stress too much.\\nTo fully complete the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application, you will need to bring the following documents when you go to the BH:</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Original Documents</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the application)</li>\\n<li>Your birth certificate, signed by an apostle</li>\\n<li>A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle</li>\\n<li>Your (at the lowest) A1 German proficiency certificate</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Copied Documents</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Your rent agreement, make sure the copy has the signature of owner of the apartment building</li>\\n<li>Flight confirmation ticket (so the BH knows how long you have to legally stay in Austria)</li>\\n<li>A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle</li>\\n<li>Your A1 certification in German. This is exam is not to be taken lightly! I did it through the Goethe Institut in U.S.</li>\\n<li>Your work contract - make sure all the work contracts have signatures.</li>\\n<li>A “simulation” of your wage with expected taxes from Austria - make sure this has signatures from your company as well.\\nWork Permit(Arbeits- bewilligung)\\nFor the work permit, you will need to fill out the Stellanantritt ohne Wohnsitznahme in Liechtenstein and Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels applications. Your company in Liechtenstein may send you these half completed, or they may not. Mine did.\\nTo fully complete the applications, you will need the following attachments:</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Original Documents</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels)</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And… that’s it. Just the passport photo. Told you it was cake compared to the residence permit.\\nThe Perfect Process\\nNow, some of the things you have seen above may not really make any sense to you. The list below will describe them and outline, if you were perfect, how you could complete the entire process without any confusion or wasting of time:</p>\\n<h2>Before Going to Austria</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Get a job offer in Liechtenstein! The company will send you contracts which you need to sign in the presence of an apostle, which you will then send back to the company for their final approval. They’ll then order the contracts which you need to fill out for Liechtenstein.</li>\\n<li>Pass your German A1 Proficiency Exam and wait for certificate to be mailed to you (this is probably easier before you go to Austria, but not impossible to do in Austria or Germany). This exam is includes basic reading, writing, and speaking in German. I did mine through the Goethe Institut. More about it here.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Once In Austria</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Obtain an Austrian Bank Account (this takes a few days because they always need to approve foreigners) this will help time saving immensely with any bank transfers you need for the apartment, such as the security deposit or first months rent.</li>\\n<li>Aggressively hunt for an apartment, get the rent contract made up and sign it with the owner of the apartment as soon as you can. (This process took me a month.)</li>\\n<li>In the meantime of all the apartment hunting, get a bunch of passport photos taken. You will need them for a few things later on.</li>\\n<li>Make your Meldezettal, or certification of registration at your local  Gemindeamt or town hall (make sure to bring your rent contract when you go!)</li>\\n<li>Go to the BH with all of the documents listed above. If you’re good (unlike me) and have all the documents when you go, you should need to go only once.</li>\\n<li>Now, this step is tricky. Liechtenstein won’t issue you a work permit without first seeing your residence permit (would be easy if you were an EU citizen - they would issue it as soon as they knew you were a citizen!) However, Austria won’t issue you a residence permit without first seeing the work permit! Catch 22 right? Well, not exactly. When you have everything ready for your residence permit at the BH, you can get help from your company and the Liechtenstein government to send a short confirmation letter saying that yes, as soon as you have your residence permit, they will issue you a work permit if you send in your residence permit for them to examine.</li>\\n<li>Now wait. Some district authority offices say it can take as long as six months to approve your residence permit. I personally think that it depends more on your start date. I don’t think they will toast you and make you wait for months if they see your start date is coming up in just a few weeks or month.</li>\\n<li>Then, eventually, the BH will call you and tell you when you can pick up your residence permit! You will have to go this time with your passport and pay a final 20 EUR to receive the residence permit. They told me to come back on a date about a week after I finally submitted everything.</li>\\n<li>Then, you will need to work with your company. The authorities in Liechtenstein will need to see that residence permit that you just got, with those two other documents I mentioned above. Probably with yet another week, then will then issue you the work permit. I picked my work permit up from my company, but maybe they sometimes mail it. I’m not sure.</li>\\n<li>Finally, you’ve done it! Hike up to a hut, sip a delicious Austrian beer and eat a big Germknödel! Try not to think about after all that paperwork your only reward is to start working!</li>\\n</ol>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"How to be an American living in Austria and working in Liechtenstein\",\"date\":\"January 17, 2018\",\"draft\":false}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/how-to-be-an-american-living-in-austria-and-working-in-liechtenstein/\",\"prev\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"07 April, 2018\",\"title\":\"I Set Aside $1000 to Learn Options Trading\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/\"}},\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/hello-world/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"12 December, 2017\",\"title\":\"Hello World - My First Post :)\",\"draft\":false,\"link\":\"https://chrisfrew.in/hello-world/\",\"relativeLink\":\"/hello-world/\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/how-to-be-an-american-living-in-austria-and-working-in-liechtenstein.json\n// module id = 565\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"site\":{\"siteMetadata\":{\"title\":\"Chris Frewin's Full Stack, Web Development, ABAP, SAPUI5, Blockchain, Machine Learning, & Natural Language Processing Blog.\",\"author\":\"Chris Frewin\"}},\"markdownRemark\":{\"id\":\"/Users/chris/projects/chrisfrew.in/src/pages/hello-world/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"html\":\"<p>I’ll be writing here for sometime into the future now, though I’m not sure how often, as I’m rather busy with the work for <a href=\\\"nlp-champs.com\\\">nlp-champs.com</a> and <a href=\\\"skillscout.herokuapp.com\\\">SkillScout</a> (the original thing that brought on the need case for <a href=\\\"nlp-champs.com\\\">nlp-champs.com</a>.

We were able to verify if the service wasn’t working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don’t worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn’t have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\\n<p>It’s called <code>sc</code>:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>C:\\\\>sc\\nDESCRIPTION:\\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\\n        Service Control Manager and services.\\nUSAGE:\\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\\n\\n\\n        The option <server> has the form \\\"\\\\\\\\ServerName\\\"\\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \\\"sc [command]\\\"\\n        Commands:\\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\\n          start-----------Starts a service.\\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Wow. That’s a monster of a command documentation. Let’s break down what we need.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The server name. We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><code>\\\\\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\\\\\ServerName”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Commands:\\n…\\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\\n<p><code>sc \\\\\\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \\\"ServiceName even with Whitespace\\\"</code></p>\\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\\n<p><code>sc \\\\\\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \\\"ServiceName even with Whitespace\\\"</code><br>\\n<code>sc \\\\\\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \\\"ServiceName even with Whitespace\\\"</code></p>\\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

However, with such a huge library comes the fact that the documentation can be a bit of a maze to get through. I mean, for the text to speech (TTS) API we’ll be talking about in this post, for the getting started guide (in “five minutes!!!” as it says on the site), they provide this old-school bash <code>curl</code> command:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><code>curl -H <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Authorization: Bearer \\\"</span><span class=\\\"token variable\\\"><span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$(</span>gcloud auth application-default print-access-token<span class=\\\"token variable\\\">)</span></span> -H <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\\\"</span> --data <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"{\\n  'input':{\\n    'text':'Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.'\\n  },\\n  'voice':{\\n    'languageCode':'en-gb',\\n    'name':'en-GB-Standard-A',\\n    'ssmlGender':'FEMALE'\\n  },\\n  'audioConfig':{\\n    'audioEncoding':'MP3'\\n  }\\n}\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">\\\"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span> synthesize-output.txt\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>I mean what the heck is that? The <code>$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)</code> did <em>not</em> work for me. Even if it did, the following steps included extracting the base64 encoded string (which is only a part of the downloaded curl file) to another file, <em>and then</em> converting that base64 file to an mp3 file. No thank you, I’m going to do it all at runtime!</p>\\n<p>Long story short, I’ve found that this time and like many times before, using Google’s APIs is usually a lot of trial and error to get the endpoints working. <sup><a href=\\\"#footnote-3\\\">1</a></sup></p>\\n<p>It wasn’t until I got to Google’s interactive POST console for their TTS module which you can use to test endpoints that I got a basic request working. That’s how I determined the bare minimum API request required below.</p>\\n<h1>You’re in Luck 😎</h1>\\n<p>There’s good news: luckily for you, I can spare you the migrain/hair pulling/rage that may ensue when trying to wrap your mind around Google’s often spotty documentation. I managed to get the TTS endpoint working, in Node.js nonetheless. In Node.js JavaScript, here is the code for converting some typed text to a tasty mp3 (granted you have a valid API key generated from googles cloud console for the )</p>\\n<p><strong><em>Note that

These ‘objects’ in SAP are numerous - orders, HUs, even warehouse bins are ‘objects’ that can be ‘locked’ when they are under modification somewhere in the system.</p>\\n<p>This can get very annoying when multiple entities want to change multiple objects in similar time frames.</p>\\n<h2>A Remedy for the Problem</h2>\\n<p>The ABAP report I’m going to go through alleviates this problem and could be useful for any company that has automatic processes applied to objects in the system, but at the same time have human users that <em>also</em> modify these objects.</p>\\n<p>The example program I will go through is for orders specifically (think TYPE AUFNR). Feel free to modify the code for any locked objects of your liking 😊 - the program logic following the locked object selection will not change, as we will soon see.</p>\\n<h2>Specific Problem</h2>\\n<p>At my company we had some batch jobs that were attempting to change orders, only to find that the users were locked by some of our employees in their own SAP GUI transactions. Nothing ‘bad’ per say was happening, we were just seeing in the protocol of those various batch jobs that the orders couldn’t be accessed. We realized a human user could easily forget they had a transaction open which locked an order, while they went off to work on something else, or were totally away from their work station.</p>\\n<p>We decided ultimately to build a timed warning system for users that happened to be locking orders, functioning as follows:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>A warning popup for the user at 5 minutes of lock time</li>\\n<li>A second warning popup for the user warning at 10 minutes of lock time</li>\\n<li>Forcefully close the transaction that was locking the order at 15 minutes of lock time</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And yes, this can all be done from an automatic process with no overseeing required! 😊</p>\\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\\n<h2>Identify Locked Objects</h2>\\n<p>The first thing we need to do is get the locked objects and times of all those locked objects across the whole system. As I said, for this example case, we are only interested in locked <em>orders</em>. This is object type <code>AUFK</code> - the order head table.

So, what can we do with this giant technical information list of key value pairs? </p>\\n<p>In SAP, this works as follows: each <em>login</em> by a user (not session number, we’re not there yet 😄)  is assigned a unique login ID which is generated based on things you log in with: the client number, system, and language. This session ID has the form of <code>TXX_UXXXXX</code>, where <code>X</code> can be any number 0-9. </p>\\n<p>Each session then has a session ID which is comprised of first the login ID as described above, with an appended <code>_MX</code>, where <code>X</code> in this case is the session number, 0-6 (session 1-7). So, we are interested in the <code>.session</code> value of this technical list:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-5ec0d.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 11.265646731571628%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAYElEQVQI12O4umTu/wuzJ/+/OGfK/+frFv3/tnMtGN/ZvfL//ZNb/z87v+v/l3uH/3+9f4QozHBz/qr/l6ct/H9j5tL/V4D08yWb/n9bu/f/22PH/3++dQWMv96+SjQGANqBiivK4jA7AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Session ID in the technical information.\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-fb8a0.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-1a291.png 148w,\\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-2bc4a.png 295w,\\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-fb8a0.png 590w,\\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-5ec0d.png 719w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>You can notice then that session 2 would have </p>\\n<p><code>modeinfo[1].session = T23_U31974_M1</code> </p>\\n<p>session 3 would have</p>\\n<p><code>modeinfo[2].session = T23_U31974_M2</code> </p>\\n<p>and so on, all the way up to session 7 - or index 6.

In such a case we would be unnecessarily sending warning messages or closing the transaction to a session which didn’t apply anymore!

Remember, each run we’ve still got their exact session number that is blocking the order, so let’s finally go in for the kill and shut down that session! Once we do that, we log which session/user/transaction combo we deleted to the spool, and this report is done!</p>\\n<h2>BDC Tricks To Finally Close The User Session</h2>\\n<p>I searched and searched, but there seems to be no function module that can explicitely close a specific user session - there’s probably good reason for this! (Though I can’t <em>possibly</em> think of why 🤔 😉) </p>\\n<p>I couldn’t even find another ‘forbidden’ <code>Th****</code> function module that can do this. However, this <em>is</em> possible through the standard SAP GUI, and we’ve already mentioned it in this post, our friend transaction <code>SM04</code>. By double clicking on a user (using me for an example), we get a list like this (sorry for the black boxes - don’t want to inadvertantly reveal anything that may be proprietary):</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n

we need to always run in server view, because we don’t want all sessions across all servers. In this way, this report can run in parallel on all your servers and concern it self only with users logged on to the server instance that this report is running on. This will make the run time a bit faster, and of course splits up the search work across all servers.</p>\\n<h1>Full Code</h1>\\n<p>The full code of the report is as follows:</p>\\n<div
