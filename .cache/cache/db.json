Lots of people on podcasts say it I say screw that. That is a lot like saying, “oh hey, did you know it’s impossible to write great apps or games if you’re a solo developer?” or, “What?!?! A nice dynamic UI, <em>with</em> a relational database backend <em>and</em> a websocket to send messages between the two!?!? You’re a madman!!!“.</p>\n<p>Wait a second - isn’t that what this whole Web 3.0 stuff is supposed to do? Empower developers to make great apps all by themselves? I mean jeez, I know us, we’ve spent hours on hours learning python, backend databases, container deploys, dabbled in numerous backend frameworks, not even getting started with your favorite modern front end framework of choice (yeah, there’s a lot of those too!) like Vue, React, Ember or more.</p>\n<p>Of course full stack developers know they are more a less a jack of all trades, master of none. I know there are people who could kick my ass at both Postgresql database maintenance, and there are just as many frontend people who could totally kick my ass with a badass UI in React.</p>\n<p>For me, full stack has always been about the adventure of software itself - its the nature of the discipline in fact - there are new tools being rolled out literally every day. I mean, really, if you’ve written backend code for databases but have also built websites (I know there are many of us out there!)- how are you supposed to write that succinctly on a resume or CV? “Hi, I’m Chris, part-time-database-program-writer-and-part-time-front-end-engineer”? I do concede that the moniker ‘full stack’ is not really a good enough description by itself. In my case, I could say ‘full stack <em>web developer</em>’. With more practice, maybe someday a full stack <em>android developer</em> - but I need to run through a lot more projects before that happens :)</p>\n<h1>:wine: A Toast to Full Stack Developers :wine:</h1>\n<p>Just because we’re not the greatest, most amazing expert in a certain language, just because we don’t know certain frameworks, just because we haven’t focused in one software engineering discipline our entire careers…</p>\n<p><em>Shouldn’t we still be able to call ourselves full stack developers?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Of course.</strong></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-aab872ec4aa1f1e0b0c375dbf6ca4c06-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h1>Add some spice to your SAPUI5 apps!</h1>\n<h2>(Or even normal webapps, for that matter)</h2>\n<p>I was a noob. I wrote in my SAPUI5 some warehouse task code that would have a real time. How did I do it?</p>\n<p>I wrote a <code>window.setInterval()</code> function that would ping table <code>/SCWM/WT</code> 😊 and check for any new lines - with an OData <code>GET_ENTITY_SET</code> server request. 😊 😊</p>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n<p>Well, I was lucky to learn about websockets from one of our EWM. Then I was even luckier to learn a bit more about the technical aspects (when to subscribe, unsubscribe, destroy, and create websockets instances from actions on the front end).</p>\n<p>So here’s how to add websockets to your SAPUI5 app<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<h2>Transactions</h2>\n<p>All backend push and messaging channels can be managed with just two transactions:  <code>SAMC</code>, for message channels and <code>SAPC</code>, for push channels. Easy enough.</p>\n<h2>Creating a Message Channel</h2>\n<p>As we will see, to create a proper push channel, we will first need a message channel, so that is where we start off. An ABAP message channel is a way of subscribing current programs to any - the best thing about push channels is that if the push channel <em>isn’t</em> listening, there is no error and nothing else negative happens anywhere else in the system - that is, granted you <code>TRY</code> and <code>CATCH</code> your push channel messaging properly.</p>\n<p>So let’s get started in transaction <code>SAMC</code>:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We define the message channel name, and, most importantly, define what programs can use this message channel and what type of message this channel will handle (there are only 2 - numeric and string)</p>\n<p>Now, as I mention before, we use these channels to hook into any ABAP program, so that any time they are executed by anyone (or anything) in the system, the channel will be messages. A safe way to hook into an existing program (using our newly created <code>Z_AWESOME_CHANNEL</code>) looks as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">REPORT</span> my_super_cool_existing_report\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>Creating a Push Channel</h2>\n<p>Ok, now we head to transaction <code>SAPC</code> - we are no going to define a websocket that will be hooked up to our push channel. That way, when something happens in our program, it will message to all subscribed channels, which will be forwarded , and then ultimately, to the most important part, the frontend for our user to see!</p>\n<h2>Frontend</h2>\n<p>On the frontend I create a general websocket function that creates a websocket instance. In order to have the correct service for each view, upon each view change I call this function, which always creates a new instance if there exists a websocket instance already. This way we are sure that on any view change, we have a fresh running instance of the websocket doing the correct task for this view.</p>\n<p>That function looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Note that you of course have to us <code>ws://</code> as the protocol in the link name!</p>\n<p>On the backend, that ends up looking like a <code>CASE</code> statement:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CASE</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>Code</h2>\n<p>Yep, you’re going to have to write some ABAP code too. Luckily for us, when we create a push channel in transaction SAPC, SAP generates a class skeleton with 4 methods:</p>\n<p><code></code>\n<code></code>\n<code></code></p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1.

With that order of magnitude of market cap, 1 Bitcoin would have:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market Capitalization</th>\n<th>Bitcoin price*</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$55,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$111,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$167,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 Trillion (market cap of gold)</td>\n<td>~$389,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*(assuming around 18 million Bitcoins - currently 16.7 as of writing this entry - it’s accurate enough as of this posting in late 2017; the 18th millionth Bitcoin isn’t expected to be mined until October 9th, 2019 - check out <a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/the-bitcoin-mining-schedule-from-december-18-2017-to-june-8-2020-407db59e69f4\">my post on medium about the mining schedule until the next halving</a>)</p>\n<p>I predict:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$20,000 by January 1st 2018 (update: we already made it for a short period of time on December 17th!)</li>\n<li>$50,000 by end of Q2 2018 (i.e. end of June 2018)</li>\n<li>$100,000 by end of Q4 2018 (i.e. end of December 2018)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>But… 5 Years Out? 10 Years?</h1>\n<p>So I have a somewhat non-average view of Bitcoin in the long run (5-10 year) time range (yes, things like <a href=\"http://blog.flippening.watch/what-is-the-flippening/\">THE FLIPPENING</a> I think could happen). The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3. And what happens to the miners once mining stop? <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/what-happens-bitcoin-miners-all-coins-mined/\">That’s still a question where I’m not totally satisfied what some of the answers are.</a></li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don’t see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these aspects of the market are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin’s ‘store of wealth’ could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it’s purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>As of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this stagnation, there will be a slow starting decrease downtrend in Bitcoin’s price, then accelerating, bringing the price of Bitcoin back to its pre-boom levels (think: $5 - $10 range). When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5-10 years. But it’s my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-e4e464cecd740f4966726934362ad719-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h2>This is a Must-Have Tool for any ABAP Developer!</h2>\n<p>Did you ever find you wanted to debug something in SAP GUI right on a certain command or action, but it was in a popup?

Server Monitor</h1>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-1-of-roadmap-and-links-to-process/\">my attempt to automate my suite of websites</a>, I wanted to build a simple Node.js server that monitors all my live sites, and sends me an email. Basically the process is simply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>‘cron’ job that every 30 seconds to ping all my websites</li>\n<li>Check for 200 response from each, if not send email</li>\n<li>If an even greater problem is found, i.e., the site doesn’t even return a 4** code, also send an email</li>\n<li>A ‘reactive’ monitor - that is, don’t just send a mail when there are problems, try to spool up the server again and log if there is a failure!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To accomplish this I utilized just three Node.js libraries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>http</code>, to request the various sites I control</li>\n<li><code>node-schedule</code>, to create a cron-like check</li>\n<li><code>nodemailer</code>, a fantastic easy-to-use bare bones emailer, we’ll send an email when there is a non 2** HTTP response or simple a non-response error (see code below) (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@manojsinghnegi/sending-an-email-using-nodemailer-gmail-7cfa0712a799\">there is a great medium post on an about 20ish liner in Node.js to get started</a>, and the setting in gmail you have to change)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously this can be developed into a much more complex monitor, but for now I am happy as to how it runs.</p>\n<h1>Improvements</h1>\n<p>A few things I would like to improve with this Server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control the <code>const</code> array from somwehere else, perhaps a management GUI where I can maintain sites</li>\n<li>A global log class that could also be used in my Chrisfrew.in Productions Twitter Bot (coming soon in another post)</li>\n<li>Increasing the information and complexity of what is sent in the emails?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Code</h1>\n<p>As always, the most <a href=\"https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in-productions-monitor\">up-to-date code will be

I want to share first how I did it, and then how I should have done it in hopes to save others time if they should wish to attempt tackling this debauchery of paperwork and bureaucracy.*</p>\n<p><sup>* Trust me when I say I’m not a legal counsel so always take my words with a grain of salt. However, as of February 2016, these were the steps I took to get started working. UPDATE 2017: The process is still the same as described here. I know this because you have to renew your permits each year for your first three years in Austria. Granted, it is much easier the second and third times as you have all of your papers in place already from the previous year!</sup></p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>When you plan on living in Austria for longer than three months, and then longer than sixth months (there are some other special visas such as a student visa, artist visa which last for sixth months), then the government requires you to apply for a Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, a specific type of Aufenhaltstitel, or residence permit, very similar to a green card in the US. Then, Liechtenstein requires that you have Aufenhaltstitel, or a working permit to legally work in Liechtenstein. Your company should help you with this process, and, since a cross border working permit for Liechtenstein is very common, the application is relatively simple compared to the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung.</p>\n<h2>Legal Entities</h2>\n<p>There are four legal entities you are going to need to work with to get everything to jive:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Perhaps most important, is the Bezirkshauptmannschaft, or “BH” for short in German, or in English, the district authority. This is where you will complete your Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, or residence permit.</li>\n<li>Another place you will visit is the Gemeindeamt, or town hall of the town your apartment is in. This is where you will make your Meldezettel, or certification of registration. When you do this registration, you want to make your Haupwohnsitz, or main place of residence to that town.</li>\n<li>You will also need to work with the Besitzer, or the owner of the apartment. If the apartment you want to rent is a private, this shouldn’t be so difficult. Unfortunately, it is quite common in Austria that apartments are owned by an apartment company, so you may have to work with one of those companies to finally get the rent contract and the signature of the official owner of the building itself.</li>\n<li>Finally, the two documents you will need to send from Liechtenstein are mandated by the Besitzer Ausländer- und Passamt, or the Immigration and Passport Office of Liechtenstein.\nLong Term Residence Permit(Nieder- lassungs- bewilligung)\nFor the residence permit, fill out the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application. If you already have your apartment, you should even be able to fill in those parts as well. If you don’t have a spouse or children, you can skip many parts of this application. Anyways, the BH will look over it when you first supply it to them anyway, so don’t stress too much.\nTo fully complete the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application, you will need to bring the following documents when you go to the BH:</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Original Documents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the application)</li>\n<li>Your birth certificate, signed by an apostle</li>\n<li>A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle</li>\n<li>Your (at the lowest) A1 German proficiency certificate</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Copied Documents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Your rent agreement, make sure the copy has the signature of owner of the apartment building</li>\n<li>Flight confirmation ticket (so the BH knows how long you have to legally stay in Austria)</li>\n<li>A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle</li>\n<li>Your A1 certification in German. This is exam is not to be taken lightly! I did it through the Goethe Institut in U.S.</li>\n<li>Your work contract - make sure all the work contracts have signatures.</li>\n<li>A “simulation” of your wage with expected taxes from Austria - make sure this has signatures from your company as well.\nWork Permit(Arbeits- bewilligung)\nFor the work permit, you will need to fill out the Stellanantritt ohne Wohnsitznahme in Liechtenstein and Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels applications. Your company in Liechtenstein may send you these half completed, or they may not. Mine did.\nTo fully complete the applications, you will need the following attachments:</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Original Documents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And… that’s it. Just the passport photo. Told you it was cake compared to the residence permit.\nThe Perfect Process\nNow, some of the things you have seen above may not really make any sense to you. The list below will describe them and outline, if you were perfect, how you could complete the entire process without any confusion or wasting of time:</p>\n<h2>Before Going to Austria</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Get a job offer in Liechtenstein! The company will send you contracts which you need to sign in the presence of an apostle, which you will then send back to the company for their final approval. They’ll then order the contracts which you need to fill out for Liechtenstein.</li>\n<li>Pass your German A1 Proficiency Exam and wait for certificate to be mailed to you (this is probably easier before you go to Austria, but not impossible to do in Austria or Germany). This exam is includes basic reading, writing, and speaking in German. I did mine through the Goethe Institut. More about it here.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Once In Austria</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain an Austrian Bank Account (this takes a few days because they always need to approve foreigners) this will help time saving immensely with any bank transfers you need for the apartment, such as the security deposit or first months rent.</li>\n<li>Aggressively hunt for an apartment, get the rent contract made up and sign it with the owner of the apartment as soon as you can. (This process took me a month.)</li>\n<li>In the meantime of all the apartment hunting, get a bunch of passport photos taken. You will need them for a few things later on.</li>\n<li>Make your Meldezettal, or certification of registration at your local  Gemindeamt or town hall (make sure to bring your rent contract when you go!)</li>\n<li>Go to the BH with all of the documents listed above. If you’re good (unlike me) and have all the documents when you go, you should need to go only once.</li>\n<li>Now, this step is tricky. Liechtenstein won’t issue you a work permit without first seeing your residence permit (would be easy if you were an EU citizen - they would issue it as soon as they knew you were a citizen!) However, Austria won’t issue you a residence permit without first seeing the work permit! Catch 22 right? Well, not exactly. When you have everything ready for your residence permit at the BH, you can get help from your company and the Liechtenstein government to send a short confirmation letter saying that yes, as soon as you have your residence permit, they will issue you a work permit if you send in your residence permit for them to examine.</li>\n<li>Now wait. Some district authority offices say it can take as long as six months to approve your residence permit. I personally think that it depends more on your start date. I don’t think they will toast you and make you wait for months if they see your start date is coming up in just a few weeks or month.</li>\n<li>Then, eventually, the BH will call you and tell you when you can pick up your residence permit! You will have to go this time with your passport and pay a final 20 EUR to receive the residence permit. They told me to come back on a date about a week after I finally submitted everything.</li>\n<li>Then, you will need to work with your company. The authorities in Liechtenstein will need to see that residence permit that you just got, with those two other documents I mentioned above. Probably with yet another week, then will then issue you the work permit. I picked my work permit up from my company, but maybe they sometimes mail it. I’m not sure.</li>\n<li>Finally, you’ve done it! Hike up to a hut, sip a delicious Austrian beer and eat a big Germknödel! Try not to think about after all that paperwork your only reward is to start working!</li>\n</ol>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-1394bab26ddea6adf8fd0b284fefff4e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h2>So, we don’t want to be rebuilding SAP GUI transactions 1:1 in the Web…</h2>\n<p>That would be like reinventing the wheel.</p>\n<p>In SAPUI5 function, that looks something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Dear SAP Gods” You shout.

Tasty.</p>\n<h1>For New York state, how can you change your DBA name?</h1>\n<p>To change your DBA name, it’s basically two steps, one at the federal level and one at the state level:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A written letter to the Internal Revenue Service stating your intent to change the name. In the case of a sole proprietorship (like mine) there is no need to change you Employee Identification Number (EIN, also known as the Tax Identification Number or Tax ID). The IRS says that you have to write to the same IRS address that you sent your last tax address for the company for. Because I have a sole proprietorship, I can file for Siren Apparel (now chrisfrew.in) to this address:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Department of the Treasury\nInternal Revenue Service\nKansas City, MO  64999-0002</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>A DTF-65 form (for New York State since I live there) also indicating the name change (in the case of other states I assume this step would be similar, just a matter of finding the proper form for your state.)</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>TL;DR;</h1>\n<p>Fill out and send two forms; and you’re legally set!</p>\n<p><em>in other words,</em></p>\n<p>😎 Its time to make some more startups. 😎</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-17765094f65c9e58cd0906ab5b534e93-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h1>Google Cloud</h1>\n<p>I’m torn most of the time about using Google Cloud APIs - on one hand, they are a group of some of the best APIs on the web today - the variety of what you can do with their APIs, whether it be maps, text to speech, search data, and more - is huge. However, with such a huge library comes the fact that the documentation can be a bit of a maze to get through. I mean, for the text to speech (TTS) API we’ll be talking about in this post, for the getting started guide (in “five minutes!!!” as it says on the site), they provide this old-school bash <code>curl</code> command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>curl -H <span class=\"token string\">\"Authorization: Bearer \"</span><span class=\"token variable\"><span class=\"token variable\">$(</span>gcloud auth application-default print-access-token<span class=\"token variable\">)</span></span> -H <span class=\"token string\">\"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\"</span> --data <span class=\"token string\">\"{\n  'input':{\n    'text':'Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.'\n  },\n  'voice':{\n    'languageCode':'en-gb',\n    'name':'en-GB-Standard-A',\n    'ssmlGender':'FEMALE'\n  },\n  'audioConfig':{\n    'audioEncoding':'MP3'\n  }\n}\"</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">></span> synthesize-output.txt\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I mean what the heck is that? The <code>$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)</code> did <em>not</em> work for me. Even if it did, the following steps included extracting the base64 encoded string (which is only a part of the downloaded curl file) to another file, <em>and then</em> converting that base64 file to an mp3 file. No thank you, I’m going to do it all at runtime!</p>\n<p>Long story short, I’ve found that this time and like many times before, using Google’s APIs is usually a lot of trial and error to get the endpoints working. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>It wasn’t until I got to Google’s interactive POST console for their TTS module which you can use to test endpoints that I got a basic request working. That’s how I determined the bare minimum API request required below.</p>\n<h1>You’re in Luck 😎</h1>\n<p>There’s good news: luckily for you, I can spare you the migrain/hair pulling/rage that may ensue when trying to wrap your mind around Google’s often spotty documentation. I managed to get the TTS endpoint working, in Node.js nonetheless. In Node.js JavaScript, here is the code for converting some typed text to a tasty mp3 (granted you have a valid API key generated from googles cloud console for the )</p>\n<p><strong><em>Note that you need the following prerequisites for this to work!</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>be in a node project <code>npm init -y</code></li>\n<li>axios installed <code>npm install --save axios</code></li>\n<li>your google TTS module API key exported (in your <code>.bash_profile</code> or similar) as <code>GOOGLE_CLOUD_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API</code>, i.e. that would be this line of bash:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>export GOOGLE_CLOUD_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API=blahblahblahblah</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the following in <code>index.js</code>:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n

Some other APIs I've found have example minimum required interface endpoints for every language they support - super clean and tasty. I'm wondering if a lack of such clean documentation is because Google is focusing more on development than maintenance and documentation of their APIs. Perhaps the challenge itself is the vastness of the Google API library, and it would take nothing short of a genius to organize a proper strategy of attack on updating and cleaning up all the documentation.\n</div>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-7d8a475e9b71afe7a6ec91d421ffbe90-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<p>Alright, let’s do a bit of applied stuff today.</p>\n<h1>Backstory</h1>\n<p>For a long time, I had a ticket open for our IT team (I am likewise in the SAP team) for an automatic job that would restart a certain task on a Windows server we had - for reasons we still don’t know yet, this particular service would state that it was running, when in fact the job it was supposed to be orchestrating was clearly not running. We were able to verify if the service wasn’t working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don’t worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn’t have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I’ll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that’s left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work).

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-86d0c50403baf699c116328c3f1df601-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h1>Bash Profile / Bashrc - Aliases, Terminal Prompt, Terminal Prompt Colors, the Works to Get Your Workflow to God-Like Levels!</h1>\n<p>This post is gonna get right to it - if you use machines that have a Bash terminal, you should build custom aliases to get around faster, do stuff faster, or just plain have a bit of fun!

profile, you wouldn’t have to be that ‘sharp’! 😂), you may have noticed I even have an alias for opening the bash profile itself (<code>prof</code>) and sourcing the profile (<code>s</code>) - this adds any of the changes you made in your bash profile - any new commands and whatnot - into the current terminal):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code><span

Improve your workflow and ease of commanding a bash terminal!</p>\n<p>-Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<p>Chris</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-0fe45ff9b7724a84c6e2dccaf6792869-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h2>Thoughts of yet another full-time worker going full-time freelance / tinkerer / creative / nomad.</h2>\n<p>***Note: this post is mirrored on my Medium: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/welp-i-did-it-24505dff1bd1\">https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/welp-i-did-it-24505dff1bd1</a></p>\n<p>I quit my full-time job.</p>\n<p>Most of the time about things like this, all you here is the same old tune:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t do this don’t do this don’t do this. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But jeez, people are so risk-averse sometime. Just thinking about my own situation, right now, I’m 100x better off than I was just 3 years ago, when I was 23, $27K in debt from my bachelor degree, and earning less than <em>half</em> of what I do now! How come nobody back then said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t do this don’t do this don’t do this</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because being a homely, unkempt, poor graduate student is <em>expected</em> by society, (although graduate school is even looked upon with reverence in some cases - “Wow, <em>Cornell</em>? Great school, great school.”). But what the hell are people thinking? In terms of net worth back then, I was totally screwed!</p>\n<p>If you are in your mid-20s reading this, you’re probably in the same situation of a strongly improved financial situation. So, why would I risk going total freelance when I have a house and kids, when <em>real</em> bills need to be paid. You’re right - I wouldn’t. </p>\n<p>The way I see it, now is not only the <em>only</em> time to try this, it’s the <em>perfect</em> time: experience and network connections from my first few years at a big industry job, with a bunch of savings as an all-else fails cushion in the bank.</p>\n<p>Even a lot of well-known ‘creatives’ these days also say not to do this until you have a self-sustaining (or better yet - profitable) side project, but I just couldn’t help but writing that notion off - most of them quit their jobs themselves when they were getting started! Yes - they talk about the strife and challenge it was from doing that, which is why they don’t recommend it to anyone else - but isn’t that exactly the ingredient required in the recipe of nearly all people who were once nobody and emerged with amazing projects and products? </p>\n<p>If you want to create truly nice projects of high quality, that aren’t just patched together, even if you are hacking away those 4-5 hours a night, <em>after</em> your full-time job, you just can’t. Well - at least I can’t. In my case, you need those multiple 12 hour, interrupted days, diving deep and building complex projects. This just isn’t sustainable with a full-time job - and indeed, perhaps this is exactly the ‘strife’ and ‘challenge’ that these creatives refer to in all of their ‘early days’. It’s true - while we all complain about our 9-5 jobs (in my case, 7-5), you can’t help but admitting there is a lot of comfortability and security in them - weekdays only, and (for most of us) 5PM is 5PM, when the clock hits 5, there’s no more work for the day. It will be interesting to see how that goes in my freelance life.</p>\n<p>But hey, it’s 2018, and “quitting your day job”, especially as a software engineer, doesn’t really mean you’re immediately ‘unemployed’ - right? There were a large number of supporting variables and events over the past few months that have led me to my decision:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>talking to <a href=\"torch.io\">torch.io</a> over a possible part time frontend consulting work</li>\n<li>being added to the <a href=\"moonlightwork.com\">Moonlight Community</a></li>\n<li>talking to a colleague about a fixed part-time position at his software company</li>\n<li>working with a friend to build a keyboard that charges as you type (I know it sounds like magic but the science and numbers show it can work) <a href=\"https://charge-keyboard.com\">charge-keyboard.com</a></li>\n<li>building out and advertising my startup Siren Apparel, and expanding to the EU <a href=\"https://sirenapparel.us\">https://sirenapparel.us</a>, <a href=\"https://sirenapparel.eu\">https://sirenapparel.eu</a></li>\n<li>(only knowing after I quit) consulting opportunities at my current company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yes, any one or a combination of these will pay the bills.</p>\n<p>I realize, <em>none</em> of these (or probably even a combination) will pay as high as my comfy logistic / warehousing full-time job. But I also realized over the past few months, <em>I don’t give a damn about money!</em> Sure, I could go the Mr. Money Mustache route and just keep truckin’ away at my current job with a high savings rate, and become financially independent in 7-8 years. But to me, that’s 7-8 years of sunk cost, working at albeit a decent, but ultimately where-I-don’t-want-to-be job. If I spent those 7-8 years building out projects that first </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Allow me enough income to survive, and </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are valuable projects that I value and believe make a difference in the world</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then I have many many years after that to continue building, instead of after those 7-8 years, starting ‘fresh’ only with the single added confidence that I am financially independent. </p>\n<p>Worst case, I fail and a year from now I run back to the security of a full-time job. (Hopefully not the case!)</p>\n<p>It’s a similar story with options trading, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-b32bf47db656\">another toy project of mine</a>. A lot of people say you can learn a lot from paper trading, but people with real trading experience say you can never really learn unless real money is on the line. If I springboard into the abyss that is freelance / maker / creative / digital nomad, I’m <em>forced</em> to do my best work, and a lot of it, because it’s the only chance I have to pay my bills. Quotes that ring to this tune can be seen all over by (now) extremely successful people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was in the zone, trying to make a living<br/>\nHeading to work in the morning<br/>\nNobody felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased<br/>\nUntil I quit my job, then my work ethic increased<br/>\nElevated to levels I ain’t ever seen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-Logic</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything that you want is on the other side of fear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-George Addair</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People will choose unhappiness over uncertainty</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-Tim Ferriss</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that in this information age, there are so many lines to connect, so many beautiful projects that can be made, so many companies and services that will flourish that we couldn’t even think of existing yet, even if we tried - but each of those requires time and hard critical thinking and problem solving. </p>\n<p>Have I accomplished something when a pallet comes out of the warehouse 5 seconds faster? In my book, not really. </p>\n<p>What if I build, with old friends from university, a revolutionary, first-of-its-kind, self-charging wireless keyboard that lasts a lifetime, and then some? I think yes. </p>\n<p>What about creating amazing designs for the 28 fire departments of each of the EU’s capital cities, monetizing it, and giving all the profits back to those departments? Yes.</p>\n<p>What about an art display: computer-assisted, colorized vector generated images of all 486 mountain lodges in the Austrian Alpine Club? Yep.</p>\n<p>And so I’m doing it - Its time for me to spread my wings and fly. I’ll check back in a year on this post - a post-mortem if you will. </p>\n<p>Hopefully it won’t be me that the post-mortem is written about.</p>\n<p>-Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<p>Chris</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-b63bd0cafb40b31a54b32a95fab86fe2-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h1>Links to All Parts of the Process</h1>\n<p>Before I get into the description, you may be here just to get the links.

However, if you’re not an authorized party (which I check via a <em>secret key</em>) you’ll just be redirected to the plain ol’ <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in\">https://chrisfrew.in</a> - yeah I know, what a crappy blog.</p>\n<p>If any of this stuff sounds cool, or perhaps more importantly, sounds like a foreign language, then c’mon in and dive in - we’ll get into the technical details and all steps of how all of this can be set up.</p>\n<p>Remember, all this stuff is open source too. The repository for the monitor is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in-productions-github-bitbucket-monitor\">https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in-productions-github-bitbucket-monitor</a></p>\n<p>(The full code is also posted at the bottom of this post.)</p>\n<h2>Setting Up a Catch-All webhooks subdomain</h2>\n<p>So <a href=\"chrisfrew.in\">chrisfrew.in</a> is registered on Namecheap.

<code>webhooks.chrisfrew.in</code>. The important thing here is to validate requests. Imagine what could happen without validation, (if I eventualy do hook this up to my twitter bot to post every time a repository is updated) just anyone could send random github-ish looking json data to <code>webhooks.chrisfrew.in</code>, and my server would take action, even when its not coming from a validate That would be really annoying, and plus, it would make me seem <em>way</em> more productive than I am with my repositories. 😂😂😂 So yeah, validation is an important step. </p>\n<p>GitHub’s way of doing authentication for webhooks is to take the content of the payload, concatenate that with the secret key, and then hash it. You then do the same on your server, since you yourself also know the secret key, and if the hashes match, violá! You know it’s coming from GitHub. We accomplish this in Nodejs in a function called <code>verifySignature</code> like so:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token comment\">// Verification function to check if it is actually GitHub who is POSTing here</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">verifySignature</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>req<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token operator\">!</span>req<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>headers<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'user-agent'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">includes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'GitHub-Hookshot'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// Compare their hmac signature to our hmac signature</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// (hmac = hash-based message authentication code)</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sExternalSignature <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> req<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>headers<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">'x-hub-signature'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> oData <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> JSON<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">stringify</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>req<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sSecret <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> process<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>env<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>WEBHOOK_SECRET<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> \n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sInternalSignature <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token string\">`sha1=</span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span>crypto<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">createHmac</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'sha1'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> sSecret<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">update</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>oData<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">digest</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'hex'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> crypto<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">timingSafeEqual</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sExternalSignature<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> Buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sInternalSignature<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>GitHub Integration</h2>\n<p>So, we know - then on the production server we want to naturally pull this newest code from the remote?

So, I am nearly approaching a fully integrated build system that was all custom built. 😄</p>\n<h2>Other Fun stuff</h2>\n<p>You know how when your <code>npm start</code> wont work, only because of a missing module? I’ve always been like, well, the <em>single</em> solution here <em>is to just install the friggen module</em> Well, thanks to stdout, we can try to read those missing modules, install it, and try <code>npm start</code> again. This is something I am working on.</p>\n<p>You’ll notice a lot of the code is parsing <code>stdout</code> as strings - I realize out to an infinite time scale, this isn’t a most robust way of checking error messages, so I’m working towards parsing the actual errors codes from Nodejs and reacting from those, instead of the error text itself.</p>\n<p>You may have also noticed the function messageHub for nearly every logging type message. Indeed, we do log to the console, but I built this hub-type function so we could add more ways of messaging, one of them is through a Slack bot, which I show how to do in <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-4-of-building-a-slack-bot/\">Part 4</a></p>\n<p>You’ll see I have logging util and twitter util functions commented out - they are coming - all with good time!</p>\n<h2>To Do List</h2>\n<p>I’ve still got to add all my other sites to the monitor - this is just a matter adding to that key:value that the server monitors - see <code>oRepositoryPathValuePairs</code> in the code below for what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>What will be really cool is for the GitHub monitor to update itself when it sees that it’s remote - yes, this is like some Terminator-level crap. This will be a special case, because in order for a flawless execution of the monitor server itself, it would have to spawn a child process of itself, then update its code, then start itself, finally killing the child process of its older version.</p>\n<h2>Full code</h2>\n<p><code>index.js</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span

The results were fairly neat. Follow along through all the technical steps I took to generate the images if you’re interested. If not, just head down to the bottom to see the results!</p>\n<h1>1. Acquiring The Pixel Maps</h1>\n<p> I found map sprites of all 20 towns from the amazing Spriter’s Resource: <a href=\"https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/pokemongoldsilver/\">https://www.spriters-resource.com/game<em>boy</em>gbc/pokemongoldsilver/</a></p>\n<h1>2. Breakdown of Maps into 16x16 Pixel Tiles</h1>\n<p>After getting all 20 towns, the only requirement is that the map that can be actually be broken into 16x16 pieces - as you’ll notice the sprite people often put all the insides of buildings onto the same .png file, so this just took careful cropping to get the part that interested me - the ‘outside’ part of the towns with the buildings, flora, and road/path tiles.</p>\n<p>(Yes, I know - with some effort this too could have been automated, but hey, it took me a total of about 15 minutes to crop the 20 towns myself, so in this case I think good old elbow grease was the faster method)</p>\n<p>I wrote a Python function <code>createTiles</code> that moves in 16x16 blocks across the maps, saving each block as it’s own separate .png

Converting PNG Tiles to SVG</h1>\n<p>But hey,.pngs that are only 16x16 pixels in size are no fun - you can’t scale that up to giant resolution wihtout inevitable blurring or such - to keep them crisp, I converted each 16x16 tile into an .svg using a previous tool that I built, <a href=\"https://github.com/frewinchristopher/pixelmatic\">pixelmatic</a>.</p>\n<p>Great, now we just need to print the tiles in a creative fashion!</p>\n<h1>4. Printing Tiles in a Hexagonal Pattern</h1>\n<p>I had this neat idea to create a spiral and print all the tiles, including repeats, from each town into an outward spiraling fashion. As you can see from my beloved notebook notes, I spent almost too long try how the heck to print the tiles out in such a pattern:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trying to figure it out.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Getting confused… STILL trying!</p>\n<p>After lots of brainstorming, I realized it was easiest to implement by creating a walking vector. Each ring has a known count of tiles, and then you just walk around the hexagon:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-python\"><code><span class=\"token

Data Analysis</h1>\n<p>Ok, I’ll admit it, the goal of this project was much more heavily leaning towards the art &#x26; design component: for ‘data analysis’ I didn’t really do much of anything except find the duplicates of each tile in each town - and how many times that tile appeared, because I needed exactly that info to generate the town designs.</p>\n<p>Building off the code that is in <a href=\"\">the repository</a>, some other interesting info would be to find:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>total number of unique tiles across the entire game - finding most unique and most repeated tile</li>\n<li>total number of colors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though perhaps hunting around on the web this info is already freely avaliable.</p>\n<p>To get the counts of each repeats, after all 16x16 tiles were generated, I got the idea to just find a python script which counts duplicate files by content (a hash comparing algorithm). I found a nice one by Andres Torres at Python Central: <a href=\"https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/\">https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/</a>. I refactored it so it could just be called as a function and return an array of each repeat file name. </p>\n<p>What I mean by this is: let’s say ‘1.svg’ was the ‘ground’ tile, and it was found to have the same contents as 336 other tiles in Goldenrod City. Well, this array would include the string ‘1.png’ as the first 336 elements, then a string with the next most repeated file name, and so on. The array that this function returns is the key looping array as we print our hexagonal style pattern in <code>printer.py</code>.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of identical tiles and how often they repeat for Goldenrod:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>336 like goldenrod/348.png (ground)\n230 like goldenrod/374.png (pink tiles)\n62 like goldenrod/1409.png (tree top)\n56 like goldenrod/823.png (water)\n56 like goldenrod/1226.png (right corner house)\n56 like goldenrod/201.png (left corner house)\n53 like goldenrod/1353.png (fence)\n51 like goldenrod/943.png (roof top right corner)\n51 like goldenrod/162.png (roof top left corner)\n48 like goldenrod/229.png (house normal wall)\n46 like goldenrod/1186.png (roof center)\n31 like goldenrod/1481.png (tree bottom)\n26 like goldenrod/400.png (roof top edge)\n26 like goldenrod/439.png (roof bottom edge)\n25 like goldenrod/539.png (top edge ground)\n25 like goldenrod/77.png (rock wall middle)\n20 like goldenrod/1368.png (shore)\n18 like goldenrod/1030.png (gold brick wall)\n17 like goldenrod/505.png (brown dirt top edge)\n15 like goldenrod/1387.png (ground with gray fence)\n14 like goldenrod/159.png (etc... you've gotta be kidding if you think I will)\n14 like goldenrod/158.png\n14 like goldenrod/980.png\n14 like goldenrod/198.png\n14 like goldenrod/429.png\n10 like goldenrod/1421.png\n10 like goldenrod/610.png\n9 like goldenrod/758.png\n9 like goldenrod/238.png\n9 like goldenrod/200.png\n9 like goldenrod/403.png\n9 like goldenrod/170.png\n9 like goldenrod/217.png\n9 like goldenrod/377.png\n8 like goldenrod/920.png\n8 like goldenrod/148.png\n6 like goldenrod/107.png\n6 like goldenrod/149.png\n6 like goldenrod/512.png\n5 like goldenrod/260.png\n5 like goldenrod/261.png\n5 like goldenrod/831.png\n5 like goldenrod/836.png\n4 like goldenrod/880.png\n4 like goldenrod/249.png\n4 like goldenrod/1031.png\n4 like goldenrod/784.png\n3 like goldenrod/570.png\n3 like goldenrod/573.png\n3 like goldenrod/548.png\n3 like goldenrod/572.png\n3 like goldenrod/248.png\n3 like goldenrod/571.png\n2 like goldenrod/389.png\n2 like goldenrod/1343.png\n2 like goldenrod/658.png\n2 like goldenrod/1171.png\n2 like goldenrod/659.png\n2 like goldenrod/997.png\n2 like goldenrod/161.png\n2 like goldenrod/924.png\n2 like goldenrod/1173.png\nTotal Duplicates: 1507</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So our return array would contain 1507 string elements, each with the value of that repeated file’s name.</p>\n<h1>6.

But I’d like to think the larger part of the popularity is the artwork.</p>\n<h1>1. Ideas, Ideas, Ideas!</h1>\n<p>If you want a post that does really well (like make front page well), it has to be very creative. Anything even slightly subpar in the creativity region, even if it is your own original content, will fail (trust me, I’ve had my share of failed attempts). The problem with this is because the subreddit has seen dozens of others of very similar posts of whatever you think is a “little bit” creative. Many members of the subreddit have posted “semi-creative” content before you, trust me. My tips for doing this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>leverage your own skills - are you an expert in skills related to the subreddit, an artist, a programmer, are you a great organizer of content or ideas - do you have any skill that could be used in a helpful way by members of the subreddit?</li>\n<li>spend a while on the subreddit, take notes of what posts do well (of the type of post you think you can make - info post) my two best have been on /r/wallstreetbets because I’ve been getting into investing and the market a lot recently, and setting aside the jokes and memes (of which I am a prime contributor), I think there is a lot of correct information on the subreddit</li>\n<li>get creative - can you combine some ideas that members of the subreddit won’t expect or will be funny, no matter what you do, I think the key point is to bring something new. Perhaps slightly with this idea is that a bonus point is if it is something - something completely new is almost always good, but a topic that has just happened recently or is relevant to current subreddit and hasn’t been discussed is a golden opportunity</li>\n<li>a good test is to check if your rushing about an idea - if you <em>are</em>, I would guess it is likely an idea many other people are or have posted about. I realized I wasn’t rushing with creating my posts, because I knew they were so creative that nobody would come close to posting anything like it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>2. Pick your Skill and Leverage It!</h1>\n<p>I selected my art and graphic design skills as my meme / post advantages. (You can examples of my previous digital (and hand made) artwork at (<a href=\"https://chrisfrewin.design\">https://chrisfrewin.design</a>)[https://chrisfrewin.design])</p>\n<p>The fun part for me was that these ‘memes’ were just pieces of art I wanted to create anyway - the advantage is that they could of course be sweet, sweet karma generators.</p>\n<h1>3. Publish it! (and Post Title selection)</h1>\n<p>Once you’re satisfied with your content your going to post (whatever it be video, blog post, image, text, whatever), its time to post! I’ve found that despite what reddit recommends, as long as your title is somewhat creative, your super awesome creative post will do just fine. Also a note with post timing / and time of day of the post, I’ve found it doesn’t really matter - I just post whenever my post is ready, I don’t do any special timings. That first one for example was posted late on a Friday evening, and the S&#x26;P Map on a  If it is truly a front page post, it will gain traction regardless - I suppose the posting time of day could control exactly <em>how</em> fast.</p>\n<p>As a final check you can review your own confidence at posting time - if you find yourself not worried at all, it’s going to do fine. If it’s a winner, you’ll know soon enough as you are bombarded with the replies to your post. I left my S&#x26;P meme for 4 hours and when I can back to check on reddit I was welcomed with over 1300 upvotes and 60+ post replies.</p>\n<p>If there is interest, I can go through my process of the technical graphic design portion of how I built these posts (I use Gimp and Inkscape - yes I’m a cheapass nerd who uses open source graphic design software 🤓)</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed and picked up a tip or two and got a laugh out of the memes!</p>\n<p>-Cheers! 🍺</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-8813502c73f81cc499ba979a13a3b39e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My Laptop Stickers Arrived!

These ‘objects’ in SAP are numerous - orders, HUs, even warehouse bins are ‘objects’ that can be ‘locked’ when they are under modification somewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>This can get very annoying when multiple entities want to change multiple objects in similar time frames.</p>\n<h2>A Remedy for the Problem</h2>\n<p>The ABAP report I’m going to go through alleviates this problem and could be useful for any company that has automatic processes applied to objects in the system, but at the same time have human users that <em>also</em> modify these objects.</p>\n<p>The example program I will go through is for orders specifically (think TYPE AUFNR). Feel free to modify the code for any locked objects of your liking 😊 - the program logic following the locked object selection will not change, as we will soon see.</p>\n<h2>Specific Problem</h2>\n<p>At my company we had some batch jobs that were attempting to change orders, only to find that the users were locked by some of our employees in their own SAP GUI transactions. Nothing ‘bad’ per say was happening, we were just seeing in the protocol of those various batch jobs that the orders couldn’t be accessed. We realized a human user could easily forget they had a transaction open which locked an order, while they went off to work on something else, or were totally away from their work station.</p>\n<p>We decided ultimately to build a timed warning system for users that happened to be locking orders, functioning as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A warning popup for the user at 5 minutes of lock time</li>\n<li>A second warning popup for the user warning at 10 minutes of lock time</li>\n<li>Forcefully close the transaction that was locking the order at 15 minutes of lock time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And yes, this can all be done from an automatic process with no overseeing required! 😊</p>\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\n<h2>Identify Locked Objects</h2>\n<p>The first thing we need to do is get the locked objects and times of all those locked objects across the whole system. As I said, for this example case, we are only interested in locked <em>orders</em>. This is object type <code>AUFK</code> - the order head table. To get a list of all locked object across the system with this type, we can use function module <code>ENQUEUE_READ</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" Get all AUFK table locks</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'ENQUEUE_READ'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    gname                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'AUFK'</span>\n    guname                <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'*'</span>              <span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" Users (all)</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    enq                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_enq\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So, by now we have our table of objects, and the users who are locking them. We will also need all the sessions open across the system. We can get that with the nice SAP Standard class <code>cl_server_info</code> (pretty obvious name, eh? 😂). </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" Get all user sessions</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CREATE</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">OBJECT</span> server_info<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\ngt_session_list <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> server_info<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-></span>get_session_list<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> with_application_info <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>However, we can’t just kill all of a user’s sessions - we only want to shut down (indeed, this is bad luck for the user that has only one SAP application window open that is blocking an order, but hey, they get two warnings before we shut them down)</p>\n<h2>The ‘Forbidden’ Kernel Call</h2>\n<p>To get the fidelity needed to find exactly which index of SAP application window, we’re gonna have go down the system rabbithole and use a f (remember, it is always 1-7 —> the classic SAP limit of 7 open windows per client)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token string\">'ThUsrInfo'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">ID</span> <span class=\"token string\">'OPCODE'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FIELD</span> opcode_usr_info\n          <span class=\"token keyword\">ID</span> <span class=\"token string\">'TID'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FIELD</span> gs_session_list<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>logon_hdl\n          <span class=\"token keyword\">ID</span> <span class=\"token string\">'WITH_APPL_INFO'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FIELD</span> with_appl_info\n          <span class=\"token keyword\">ID</span> <span class=\"token string\">'TABLE'</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FIELD</span> gt_usr_info[]<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>What this kernel call retrieves and puts in table <code>gt_user_info</code> can be also found be found through the standard SAP GUI in transaction <code>SM04</code> by selecting a session and going to the top menu bar and selecting User->Technical Information):</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/technical-information-9b05195c36320c323af71fb3bcb5bf8c-0473d.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 234px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 64.52991452991454%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAYAAACpUE5eAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACSElEQVQ4y62T228SQRTG+TtNfKiXR5/1Rft/GNPSlybWxKhNTKy9AL2xIIW2XARKgV0KdKHALnthF3Z/DlPbtEn1wTjJlzkz3znfmTNnJjKuN7BU9b8hMnVcKkmFi2IJvXpOq1CiU6ow0lpY/T66SOiODKa2w1jXuVI1XMOEmY95qTNsd5lNPKxen2GrRSQIAoxej5Egc1sxvq6+J5dIYrY76JpKs1TCn0zwHJuLaoVGoYgztpiPZj6P3mpLu6c20Mrl+Qkdkd3GHY7whKNrmtjSHot5iNG/whoa+JaNNRjI5O5oJPd7Iqkt9rpqC8cwZHyEWYDn2eydrslMnu+xv7fP9tY36udVvm/GaOs9yRkiKJVS+JFJc3R8TCweI51OoWoa80rnIxKGodAM6XTy0FliqkUxq28J2ytM1WVmrShecwmn/k5wy8JnRc7BRRSEz9yPO5Ale4YoVVfh7CXh2SKN+As2oo9IfnzK7ocF0p+ecbz+XKyfEF99zI5AYm0B8+QV1BdFzGuovZGQTdGzeQbispnUmBo/MbtZcGuEdlWCv+CGD8ZlaUtBLaHQTWWv71A8gUIhz/b2Jqcnebk39xE38+AIfxPNZhNdPCspqMYO6SrZ2+BrgRBLdNoUXZ/Ngtvg8A+CNzGRUBi9XJHLk7IkpqLLGeWQRGKXynmNxE6cvd04qaMMtjO5J/LgCeeCl9kipwd5KTYRP8ITv+dfcd2UXIFBsSozuaLrW5sbJFPpe6XcPY3nWKQzGT6vf0FJHpBU0vi+L7lfkFnBCRvEn1AAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"How to navigate to technical information in SAP GUI transaction SM04\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/technical-information-9b05195c36320c323af71fb3bcb5bf8c-0473d.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/technical-information-9b05195c36320c323af71fb3bcb5bf8c-04291.png 148w,\n/static/technical-information-9b05195c36320c323af71fb3bcb5bf8c-0473d.png 234w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>You will see a giant list of multiple fields for each session number (0-6) that the user has open. So, what can we do with this giant technical information list of key value pairs? </p>\n<p>In SAP, this works as follows: each <em>login</em> by a user (not session number, we’re not there yet 😄)  is assigned a unique login ID which is generated based on things you log in with: the client number, system, and language. This session ID has the form of <code>TXX_UXXXXX</code>, where <code>X</code> can be any number 0-9. </p>\n<p>Each session then has a session ID which is comprised of first the login ID as described above, with an appended <code>_MX</code>, where <code>X</code> in this case is the session number, 0-6 (session 1-7). So, we are interested in the <code>.session</code> value of this technical list:</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-5ec0d.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 11.265646731571628%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAYElEQVQI12O4umTu/wuzJ/+/OGfK/+frFv3/tnMtGN/ZvfL//ZNb/z87v+v/l3uH/3+9f4QozHBz/qr/l6ct/H9j5tL/V4D08yWb/n9bu/f/22PH/3++dQWMv96+SjQGANqBiivK4jA7AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Session ID in the technical information.\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-fb8a0.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/session-id-3587fb6b396ec22b4ee4f7c23e2ff4ea-5ec0d.png 719w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>You can notice then that session 2 would have </p>\n<p><code>modeinfo[1].session = T23_U31974_M1</code> </p>\n<p>session 3 would have</p>\n<p><code>modeinfo[2].session = T23_U31974_M2</code> </p>\n<p>and so on, all the way up to session 7 - or index 6.

BDC method to close that specific session ID for that user alone (explained below). I decided to run the program with this one-user-at-a-time method in order to have the minimum amount of time between finding a session that was locking an object and messaging / deleting that session. </p>\n<p>If we had say, 1000 locked orders on our system, and I built an entire list of all blocking sessions across all users, it could be the case that by the time we get to the BDC method (which, by the way, is slow itself, especially when you need it to be synchronous as we need in this process), the user could have already closed that blocking session, or worse, switched to a transaction in that session number which was no longer blocking the order! In such a case we would be unnecessarily sending warning messages or closing the transaction to a session which didn’t apply anymore! Bad.</p>\n<p>So - we’ve pinpointed the exact user and their session number that is blocking the order - let’s send them our warning messages at 5 and 10 minutes.</p>\n<h2>No Way!

However, this <em>is</em> possible through the standard SAP GUI, and we’ve already mentioned it in this post, our friend transaction <code>SM04</code>.

run in server view, because we don’t want all sessions across all servers. In this way, this report can run in parallel on all your servers and concern it self only with users logged on to the server instance that this report is running on. This will make the run time a bit faster, and of course splits up the search work across all servers.</p>\n<h1>Full Code</h1>\n<p>The full code of the report is as follows:</p>\n<div

However, as part of my indentured servitude that is being a full-time employee, I spent a day tinkering, writing, and testing code with these function modules. No matter what combinations of inputs I provided, I couldn’t get the <em>activity confirmation amount</em> to be calculated, which are a very important part of the final calculation of the confirmation! (more on the actual final confirmation submission is also included in later on) From scrounging around on SCN and the SAP blog, I learned that many developers had the same issue with these functions. (Things like date, yield/scrap amounts, and the goods movements would be proposed just fine by these BAPIs.)</p>\n<p>So, <strong>calculating these activity confirmation amounts programmatically (in ABAP) will be the main focus of this post <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, with much more digging, the reason the two functions wouldn’t produce activity confirmation amounts never became quite clear to me. I realized I would have to calculate them in a more manual manner and then add them to those BAPI structures <code>lt_timetickets</code> manually.</p>\n<h2>The Calculation Function Module</h2>\n<p>Through SAP GUI in transaction <code>CO11N</code>, determining system-proposed confirmation amounts is easy enough by and asking the system to do the calculation for us <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">2</a></sup>. My struggle was finding the programmatic way to do this in ABAP.</p>\n<p>Anyone with significant production planning experience (i.e., not me 😂 ) knows that the actual formula behind the activity calculation is not with the activity itself, but with the work center <em>behind</em> the activity <sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In transaction <code>CR03</code> (display work center), in the ‘Costing’ Tab, there is a ‘Formula’ button with the check symbol on it:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was my starting point to find any sort of function that could do this programmatically - with more time, I learned from SCN of a function that does exactly that!

Well, first, they are doing a do loop six times. Aha, we know why - because there can be a total of six confirmation values <sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">4</a></sup>  - SAP is by default looping over all of them.</p>\n<p>Now for the function parameters themselves: they pass the work center code (<code>arbid</code>), the operation number (<code>rcrop</code>), the index of the confirmation (a value of 1-6), our 4 default values (<code>vgw</code>), and the date (<code>date</code>).</p>\n<p>In turn, the function spits out the fixed value amount of the activity calculation (<code>value_fix</code>), the variable part (<code>value_var</code>), both in whatever unit the function gives out in <code>unit</code>, and <code>co_a</code> is for the cost center accounting <sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\">5</a></sup>. There are actually four exceptions to this function, so I’m not sure why SAP internal is taking only two of them. In any case, there are other <code>IMPORTING</code> and <code>EXPORTING</code> parameters in the function signature, but this looks like a good starting point as a minimum. In fact, as you’ll see below, the final working version of the code I created is almost exactly the same except where I found out with a bit of playing around.</p>\n<p>So I mentioned the default values that must go into <code>vgw</code> - these are the four values that are the equivalent of those four fields we can type into in <code>COR3</code> for checking the formula, things like setup time, machine time, personnel setup, and personnel time. It might sound like a lot of work to hunt down these values, but luckily these are master data and can be determined with a few select statements, first from table <code>AFVC</code> ‘operation within an order’, and then table <code>PLPO</code> ‘task list - operation/activity’:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" this is the full key for table AFVC - operation within an order - for the routing number and counter - should always work with SELECT SINGLE</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">SINGLE</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> afvc <span class=\"token keyword\">INTO</span> ls_afvc\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">WHERE</span> aufpl <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ls_operation<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>routing_no\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">AND</span>   aplzl <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ls_operation<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>counter<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n\n<span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" this is the full key for table PLPO - task list - operation/activity - so it should always work with SELECT SINGLE</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">SINGLE</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> plpo <span class=\"token keyword\">INTO</span> ls_plpo\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">WHERE</span> plnty <span class=\"token keyword\">EQ</span> ls_afvc<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>plnty\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">AND</span> plnnr <span class=\"token keyword\">EQ</span> ls_afvc<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>plnnr\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">AND</span> plnkn <span class=\"token keyword\">EQ</span> ls_afvc<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>plnkn\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">AND</span> zaehl <span class=\"token keyword\">EQ</span> ls_afvc<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>zaehl<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The routing number <code>ls_operation-routing_no</code> and counter <code>ls_operation-counter</code> we’ve gotten from function <code>BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" need only the operations from the function</span>\n    ls_order_objects<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>operations <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">'X'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    lv_number <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ls_orderid_so<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>low<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL'</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n        <span class=\"token keyword\">number</span>        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> lv_number\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       COLLECTIVE_ORDER       =</span>\n        order_objects <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> ls_order_objects\n<span class=\"token comment\">*     IMPORTING</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       RETURN        =</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       HEADER        =</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       POSITION      =</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       SEQUENCE      =</span>\n        operation     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> lt_operation\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       TRIGGER_POINT =</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       COMPONENT     =</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*       PROD_REL_TOOL =</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>(There is plenty of SAP standard documentation and discussion on SCN on how to use <code>BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL</code>, so I’ll leave that to you if you need more info 😉.

The important thing to notice is that the key challenging part here, calculating the confirmation activity amounts, uses the same internal function module, <code></code></p>\n<p>Here’s the code for calculating activities for process orders - <em>note the slight change in all the variable names!</em> - and be careful with your types (carefully look over the <code>DATA:</code> statement), otherwise you’ll get 💥<strong>exploding runtime errors</strong>💥 when you try to confirm something with one of our two main functions and you pass, for example, the  <code>lt_timetickets</code> with the production type <code></code>, and you pass it into the of the <em>process</em> order function module.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code>  <span

Did it feel like a marathon? :runner: Because it felt to <em>me</em> like a marathon all that time I was scratching my head. I hope you all enjoyed and found this post useful for a not-so-often programmed function of this production planning section of SAP.</p>\n<p>Another note and quick plug 😄 I hope everyone can appreciate the time I put into creating these posts (<em>hint:</em> posts this long take a <strong>LONG</strong> time to write!). It would make me happy and give me the motivation to keep writing these detailed ABAP posts if you’d consider donating (in the footer of any page on this blog) I have a <a href=\"https://www.paypal.me/chrisfrewin\">PayPal.me link</a>, and I’m also an Ethereum developer if you’d like to donate Ether or if you would like to donate some RaiBlocks, as I am a RaiBlocks enthusiast if you would prefer to donate in that way.</p>\n<p>💩 Ok, plug done! 💩</p>\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1. Activities/phases are for production orders; Operations are for process orders. From this point onward, I will refer just to activities, since this post focuses on production orders.

Note: At my company, we usually use only up to four confirmation activities.

I ended up determining that you can exclude parameter `co_a` without any issues - however, this may be how the settings at my own company work - you can look deeper into the SAP example to include it.\n</div>\n<div id=\"footnote-6\">\n6. This issue does not affect the confirmation formulas, but rather the goods movements in the retrograde ingredients - specifically when the goods movements are to be overridden, for example with a batch split for a retrograde material, or a custom under- or over- amount of a retrograde material. For the rare case where an employee wanted to book some of our retrograde materials from various batch numbers and warehouse locations, they noticed in these custom goods movements with the confirmation were not being added; but rather always the default SAP-calculated amounts. After some head scratching, I found it all has to do with function module <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> (or <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> depending on your use case) - I was not passing in an important parameter which allows exactly this desired override behavior:\n<pre>\nLinkConfGoodsmov\nThe assignment of the goods movements to a confirmation is effected\nvia the LinkConfGoodsmov table. There must be an entry in this table\nfor every entry in the Goodsmovements table. The index in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line of the\nassociated confirmation in the Timetickets table and the index in\nthe LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field refers the associated\ngoods movement in the Goodsmovements table.\nIf you want to prevent a goods movement from being posted for a\nconfirmation according to the standard logic, make an entry in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov table as well as in the Timetickets table. The\nindex in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line\nof the associated confirmation in the Timetickets table. Enter the\ninitial value 0 in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field. It is\nnot necessary to make an entry in the Goodsmovements table in this\ncase.\nIf there is no entry in the LinkConfGoodsmov table for a\nconfirmation, goods movements are determined for backflushing and\nautomatic goods receipt using the standard logic.\n</pre>\n<p>We needed to add the following too our goods movements loop (already added in the code above! 😄):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code>BLAH\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n</div>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-935b266095dc08ce5d9c84d4a7bc833a-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Led Zeppelin Data Analysis for Lyric Generation and Inspiration\ndate: \"2018-07-26\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":110},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"*","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":112},"end":{"line":7,"column":3,"offset":114},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"*","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":3,"offset":114},"end":{"line":7,"column":5,"offset":116},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"*","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":5,"offset":116},"end":{"line":7,"column":7,"offset":118},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"Note: this post is mirrored on NLP Champs: ","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":7,"offset":118},"end":{"line":7,"column":50,"offset":161},"indent":[]}},{"type":"link","title":null,"url":"https://nlp-champs.com/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration","children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://nlp-champs.com/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":51,"offset":162},"end":{"line":7,"column":137,"offset":248},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":50,"offset":161},"end":{"line":7,"column":226,"offset":337},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":112},"end":{"line":7,"column":226,"offset":337},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Inspiration and Motivation","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":4,"offset":342},"end":{"line":9,"column":30,"offset":368},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":339},"end":{"line":9,"column":30,"offset":368},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been recently inspired by Greta Van Fleet, basically the latest band since the Black Keys that can truly rock.

This naturally has gotten me listening to Led Zeppelin again as well, and I’ve even been getting back to writing a few classic rock style tunes with my acoustic guitar. This was a neat little project I threw together in order to try to generate some new lyrics, and also to see what could make those Led Zeppelin / Greta Van Fleet lyrics just so… <em>zepplin-ey</em> 😄</p>\n<h2>Important: I’m Lazy.</h2>\n<p>Yep, if anyone out there has been following along in my blogging adventures, you’ll know that I’m lazy. Anything that can be automated, I’m going to try to automate it! (Or in the very least, partially automate it or find a tool to use to make my life easier.) Actually, the entire concept of this post reflects my laziness: I’m willing to make a tool that generates lyrics <em>for</em> me before I visit my buddy this summer as we prepare to write an EP together! (Yikes! - I’ll let you know how <em>that</em> goes!)</p>\n<h2>Getting the List of Song Names</h2>\n<p>There’s this neat tool that I found that extracts lists from Wikipedia pages: <a href=\"http://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/\">http://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/</a>, built by Gregor Weichbrodt. Nice one, Gregor! And… (yes you can see where this is going) of course, Wikipedia has a list for everything <sup>TM</sup> (no, that is not actually trademarked) And guess what? They have a “List of songs recorded by Led Zeppelin” page! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Led_Zeppelin\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Led_Zeppelin</a></p>\n<p>Throw that into Gregor’s tool, and you’ve got your .csv data, which with 5 seconds work with Sublime text, becomes our song list:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-python\"><code>lSongNames <span class=\"token

   </div>\n<h2>Getting Lyrics for Each Song</h2>\n<p>So great, we’ve got our list of songs in Python syntax. We need the actual <em>lyrics</em> now. And yes, I’m going to continue this post’s laziness theme! I could go to Google, copy, and paste song lyrics for each of those Led Zeppelin songs, but hey, zep has over 100 songs! No way I’m that un-lazy. Let’s automate it.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is yet <em>another</em> tool that can help us! Enter <em>figurative drum roll please…</em> 🥁🥁🥁 LyricWikia, written by enricobacis on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/enricobacis/lyricwikia\">https://github.com/enricobacis/lyricwikia</a> (I mean, c’mon, the example in the README is even Led Zeppelin’s Stairway to Heaven!)</p>\n<p>So, we’re basically done. We loop over our songs and write the retrieved lyrics to their own file. We are also going to write a ‘global’ lyrics file - simply all the lyrics strings concatenated together to a file called <code>input.txt</code> —> don’t worry; I’m not crazy, this will be important later. Data retrieval code is done and looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>get_lyrics.py</code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-python\"><code><span class=\"token

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”?

Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is 3540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: its only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. OK you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows to similiar loooong outlooks: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early finanical independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k withdrawl is at 59.5 years of age and roth - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own snake oil. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant year contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”?

Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<div className=\"text-center\" **$600,000.00**</div>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<p>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </p>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<p>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh…)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a <em>very</em> nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we’re getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</p>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<p>35 people to give me $10000 <em>twice</em>\n350 people to give me $1000 <em>twice</em>\n3500 people to give me $100 <em>twice</em>\n35,000 people to give me $10 <em>twice</em>\n350,000 people to give me $1 <em>twice</em> </p>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<p>14 people to give me $10000 <em>five times</em>\n140 people to give me $1000 <em>five times</em>\n1400 people to give me $100 <em>five times</em>\n14000 people to give me $10 <em>five times</em>\n140,000 people to give me $1 <em>five times</em> </p>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!!

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!!

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use.

You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 _twice_ \n350 people to give me $1000 _twice_ \n3500 people to give me $100 _twice_ \n35,000 people to give me $10 _twice_ \n350,000 people to give me $1 _twice_ </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>With a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 _five times_ \n140 people to give me $1000 _five times_ \n1400 people to give me $100 _five times_ \n14000 people to give me $10 _five times_ \n140,000 people to give me $1 _five times_ \n``\n\nSo this is my own personal version of probably what is known as 'lean' FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don't try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don't think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won't lead to any innovation or great works.\n\nSo my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you're not sure of what to do. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won't need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:\n\nWhat will you build?</code></pre>\n      </div>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-46b5d6809870fe093c8c4666db827a4e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”?

Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawl (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of probably what is known as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use.

You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if you’re not sure of what to do. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-124e0b0de59373432e1eb1eddd5bae7d-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-2cb3633ca000ab2c096ab634403c78c2-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-a35265d1be914e046e01295fad1eea14-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach 1 million (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to 1 million and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to 1 million before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded 1 million target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to 1 million and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-8ae2ff142706b39d7d3e8d10775a2092-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-0238e6009e6c302d028a3c089531d5da-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million.</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-02235a5b7105920d0e9adb741bb97eac-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-c5c8115540570f196ab7af1ed6e8726e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-9e9f249d0bbb6f870f476106a1048dc2-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-03f2482aebdf0a6979136d23a6333fe5-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-29a5b083d7da7f43ead24b43798b5d7f-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-5280c75a6e7edf505dd3238335d0aae3-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-c54fb196665b4c50768391ee03dd86c1-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-00243a221328d0379e5af55b5c52b540-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!?

I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-9f7126db56f69ebc79a3cc62c5b23566-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!?

I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So this is my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-691740ce3ec06f32ff44e83f9fac6467-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-1f61c67e0f071a919af0fd70efbc876e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services.

Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-5894027cc7e9b01d3bae0612eb0fdd36-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let’s dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html\">https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html</a>). </p>\n<p>If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: <a href=\"https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement\">https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>. </p>\n<p>At this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yes, these numbers are <em>way</em> to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000… but it does get you thinking…</p>\n<h2>My Call to Anyone Who is Listening</h2>\n<p>So that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions. Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-b5dc3056e77eee7a1e3d4d407bd5c47c-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”?

Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year.

In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yes, these numbers are <em>way</em> to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000… but it does get you thinking…</p>\n<h2>My Call to Anyone Who is Listening</h2>\n<p>So that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions - even better when that passion can generate more income, and I think you’ll find it does when you spend years building something. </p>\n<p>Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-b7c8e75678f7d669192d21075f6bce4a-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Oh, you complain, don’t forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you’re right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it’s only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million… -_-</p>\n<p>Yeah. Let’s let that sink in for a while… </p>\n<p>Still wanna get to $1,000,000 before “pulling the trigger”?

Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year.

In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yes, these numbers are <em>way</em> to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000… but it does get you thinking…</p>\n<h2>My Call to Anyone Who is Listening</h2>\n<p>So that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions - even better when that passion can generate more income, and I think you’ll find it does when you spend years building something. </p>\n<p>Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years cushion to ride out on and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-b6a6e8d6914d2a9cb04f20163ec4aafc-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: More Thoughts On Early Retirement, Financial Independence, and Making a Living Worth Living\ndate: \"2018-10-11\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":138},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I’ve seen thrown around our very own interwebs.

Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yes, these numbers are <em>way</em> to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000… but it does get you thinking…</p>\n<h2>My Call to Anyone Who is Listening</h2>\n<p>So that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions - even better when that passion can generate more income, and I think you’ll find it does when you spend years building something. </p>\n<p>Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years cushion to ride out on and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades.

(Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black ‘working’ and ‘not working’ buckets - it’s never like that anyway).</p>\n<p>I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven’t run the numbers themselves. </p>\n<p>Listen, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let’s raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.</p>\n<p>Even at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I’m sorry, I think that’s a bunch of snake oil. In short:</p>\n<p><strong>Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.</strong></p>\n<p>I see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these ‘touters’ and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you’d better think (you’d need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you’re gonna take the tax hit.) </p>\n<p>These are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound<em>interest</em>calculator.htm</a></p>\n<p>If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won’t even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I’ve laid out the numbers as plan as I could.</p>\n<h2>Get Real With a More Realistic Target</h2>\n<p>Therefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can “quit your job” (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:</p>\n<p><strong>$600,000.00</strong></p>\n<p>I hear the internet laughing: “600K?!” You all chuckle, “Why, that’s just only over <em>half</em> of a big ol’ million!” Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that’s already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S’s per year?)</li>\n<li>Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my “financial independence” target)</li>\n<li><strong>Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I’ll be 37 then. That means, if I don’t do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I’m 62. But I haven’t included a key variable: <em>time</em>. This 25 year figure doesn’t include the face that over those 25 years, the money I <em>don’t</em> take out of my index funds is <em>still gaining value at 4%, year over year</em>. Let’s take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>Year 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Just within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of ‘extra’ of market gains, simply because we didn’t draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window… indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?</p>\n<p>Does anyone realize, when you “retire” you don’t cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You’re gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!</p>\n<p>Because you’re only cashing out 25K per year. <strong>Living frugally is key here.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent</h2>\n<p>Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.</p>\n<p>Because, let’s be honest, if you can’t find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you’ve got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.</p>\n<h2>A Weird  Actuary’s View of Getting to 700K</h2>\n<p>For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s consider returning customers:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Super awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times </code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Yes, these numbers are <em>way</em> to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000… but it does get you thinking…</p>\n<h2>My Call to Anyone Who is Listening</h2>\n<p>So that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as ‘lean’ FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don’t try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don’t think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won’t lead to any innovation or great works.</p>\n<p>So my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions - even better when that passion can generate more income, and I think you’ll find it does when you spend years building something. </p>\n<p>Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years cushion to ride out on and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don’t care! Whatever you do, don’t sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are <em>scared</em>. Remember, you won’t need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:</p>\n<p>What will you build?</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>"}]}
